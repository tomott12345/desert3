# b'Surit to Igittsam'

## b'Tscha'
b'The traveller, at the edge of monumental Tscha, may see the famous barbican of Itsch. Although from so far it may look beautiful, the people of Tscha find its bulk disagreeable, and stay away from it. Slightly nearer to the inner parts of the city, one can faintly hear songs of hopeful dejection, sung by philosophers of the Grey Quarter. Eventually the scent of *amiudtsam* trees fills the breeze, and the traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b"In the Artisans' District, the back-streets are paved with stone, inlaid with granite. An inattentive observer will not notice the *mitatig* plants. These function as a reminder of the sickness which in times past beset a nearby village. Actors cluster here, praying and dancing."

## b'Surizka'
b'From Tscha a traveller may journey to Surizka. When the traveller crosses the border into Suribschit, the vegetation changes, giving way to scrubland and pastures. *Niid* trees grow by the road.'

b'Near to the immense metropolis a traveller can stumble upon silversmiths, hawking their wares. Slightly closer to the centre of the city, the traveller will hear the chimes of the university clock. Ultimately the fragrance of *ru* fruit fills the wind, and one is surely in Surizka.'

b'Around the watchtower of Zamtschupri, the streets are lined with *niid* bushes, and the pleasant bouquet fills the early night breeze. Should the traveller be charmed enough to find a game of *titschbintannim*, it may be a most instructive experience. The sandstone medallions that grace the doorways will be easy to see. These denote the shop of a smith. Soldiers gather here, talking.'

## b'Izigpin'
b'Leaving Surizka one can go north to Izigpin. The route is long, but scenic, taking some weeks. On the track, shaggy *tsun* graze. At one point the track crosses a broad rift. As a traveller crosses the border into Surdigit, the foliage changes, giving way to open fields and wild *amiudtsam* plants.'

b'A traveller, near the walls of the iniquitous city of Izigpin, can observe the golden lookout of the infamous bastion of Irmumbidisch. From such a large distance, one is unable to discern how the idle rich steer clear of it. Nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the delicate song of the *naisch* birds, kept by farmers. At last the aroma of *niid* trees fills the air, and one has truly arrived.'

b"In the Merchants' Quarter of the city, the squares are paved with basalt, inlaid with *pat* stone. Citizens lounge here, trying their luck on the *schittan* tables. The traveller will notice the tame *abinarpit* birds. These serve as a deterrent to harmful spirits."

## b'i-Iztsa'
b'Onwards from Izigpin a traveller may travel north to i-Iztsa. The road is crowded, and the journey takes but three hours. Near the fringe of the route, *niid* plants grow. When the traveller enters Tschip, there is a variation in the light, and a golden cast falls across the land. Along the way the track crosses a deep canyon, spotted with *mitatig* bushes.'

b'Passing into the city one will make out the glistening spire of the mighty temple of I-Bid. Somewhat closer to the centre of the city, a traveller begins to hear the striking of the palace clock. Eventually the musk of *ru* fruit fills the wind, and one is beyond doubt in i-Iztsa.'

b'Near the fortress, the plazas are paved with lead. A traveller can usually hear songs of elegiac delight, sung by labourers of the Temple District. If the traveller is so fortunate as to come across the bourgeoisie talking, the traveller may be drawn in, and it can be an afternoon before escape is possible. Artisans swarm here, laughing and dancing. The *niid* flowers will be conspicuous. These signify the place of business of a fortune-teller.'

## b'Kazagiz'
b'Leaving i-Iztsa one can go north-east to Kazagiz. The route is well-trodden, and the journey takes but half a day. Horned *tsun* graze near the roadside. At one point the road crosses a broad depression.'

b'The traveller, on reaching the edge of tremendous Kazagiz, will see mighty *im*, the national animal of Igittsam. A little nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the tolling of the castle clock. Finally the perfume of *nib* bushes fills the breeze, and one has surely arrived.'

b"In the Tailors' Quarter of the city, the back-streets are lined with *niid* trees. In the event that one is lucky enough to encounter a fight between two lovers, it can be a very educational experience. Writers flock here, singing."
