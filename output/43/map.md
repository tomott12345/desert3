# b'Asamulatiem to Ukiemus'

## b'Ikamiekulaun'
b'Near to the city a traveller will stumble upon a series of merchants, setting out their stalls. Closer to the centre of the city, one begins to hear the sound of the dancing-hall clock. At last the musk of *aunipam* fruit fills the air, and the traveller has undeniably arrived.'

b'In the Green Quarter of the city, the squares are paved with ivory. In the early evening, a traveller can usually hear songs of doleful joy, sung by merchants of a nearby village. In the event that one is so unlucky as to come across writers singing, the traveller may be drawn in, and unable to leave. The *alauninupil* flowers will be tricky to miss to a traveller. These signify the shop of a fortune-teller. The idle rich swarm here, telling stories.'

## b'Amikiemietik'
b'Leaving Ikamiekulaun a traveller can travel to Amikiemietik. The road is well-trodden, and the journey takes but a few hours. Near the roadside, horned *ienamauk* graze. When the traveller crosses the border into ies Ipatatun, there is a change in the quality of the light, and a golden cast falls over the terrain. Along the way the track crosses a broad valley, spotted with *aumataunus* trees.'

b'The traveller, near the edge of Amikiemietik, can observe the sapphire spire of the colossal market-hall of Ies Ikusil. While from here it may appear enchanting, the people of the city find its form distasteful, and steer clear of it. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, one will hear the striking of the prison clock. Ultimately the fragrance of *inimisiek* bushes fills the wind, and the traveller is without a doubt in Amikiemietik.'

b'Close to the counting-house of Asikis, the boulevards are lined with *auniliel* flowers, and the red petals whisper in the breeze. Artisans throng here, praying and laughing. In the night, a traveller may often hear songs of joyous sadness, sung by labourers of the city. If the traveller is lucky enough to find a squabble between two lovers, it can be a most edifying experience. A hasty observer will not notice the sandstone columns that grace the doorways. These betoken the home of a smith.'

## b'Aunisiliek'
b'Onwards from Amikiemietik one can go south to Aunisiliek. The route is busy, and the journey takes but half a day. *Alauninupil* plants grow by the road. At one point the route crosses a broad depression, spotted with *aumataunus* trees. As a traveller enters Aukinuk, there is a variation in the light, and a harsh cast falls upon the land.'

b'Passing into the famous city of Aunisiliek the traveller can encounter *amienak*, valued for their milk. A little closer to the heart of the city, a traveller will begin to hear the delicate song of the *unamil* birds, kept by scholars. Eventually the musk of *aupausun* fruit fills the breeze, and the traveller is surely in Aunisiliek.'

b'In the vicinity of the watchtower of Ilasilil, the alleyways are paved with basalt, inlaid with granite. In the event that one is so unlucky as to come across a game of *ietutanautut*, it may be a couple of hours before escape is possible. The traveller can occasionally hear songs of plaintive delight, sung by merchants of the surrounding countryside.'

## b'Ielaupusaus'
b'Leaving Aunisiliek a traveller may travel south to Ielaupusaus. It is a pleasant journey. When one crosses into Ukiemus, the greenery changes, giving way to woods of *anaunaum* plants and *imusienasul* bushes. At one point the track crosses a deep chasm, spotted with *aumataunus* plants. On the verge of the route, *atilupipin* graze.'

b'Nearing the outskirts of the mighty city a traveller may discern the tremendous palace of Asikaniek. From so far, the traveller cannot catch sight of how priests lounge around its door, trying their luck on the *ununinutien* field. Slightly nearer to the centre of the city, one can faintly hear the gentle song of the *unamil* birds, kept by writers. At last the scent of *aunamaut* trees fills the wind, and a traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'In the Blue District of the city, the plazas are lined with *alauninupil* flowers. Artisans cluster here, dancing and praying. Should the traveller be ill-fated enough to find scholars talking, it may be a very educational experience. In the late night, one may typically hear the peal of the temple clock.'
