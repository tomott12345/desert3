# b'Zhij Tid to Gut bas Zah'

## b'sin Sguch'
b'The traveller, on reaching the edge of the colossal city, can make out the jade roof of the famous castle of Szh\xc3\xadzh Skaw. Although from here it may look quaint, the citizens of sin Sguch find its form distasteful, and stay away from it. Somewhat nearer to the heart of the city, a traveller can faintly hear songs of buoyant misery, sung by the idle rich of the surrounding countryside. At last the bouquet of *h\xc3\xa1ch* plants fills the air, and the traveller has undeniably arrived.'

b'Around the fortress, the alleyways are lined with *h\xc3\xa1ch* plants, and the pleasant fragrance fills the late morning breeze. Actors congregate here, trying their luck at *sgut*. Should a traveller be ill-fated enough to see the intricate Mam Sdach procession, the traveller may be drawn in, and it may be an afternoon before escape is possible. In the night, one can occasionally hear the gentle song of the *taw* birds.'

## b'sin Sm\xc3\xa1ch'
b'Leaving sin Sguch a traveller may travel west to sin Sm\xc3\xa1ch. It is a simple journey. When the traveller enters Gut bas Zah, there is a variation in the quality of the light, and a grey cast falls upon the terrain. At one point the road crosses a broad depression, spotted with *h\xc3\xa1ch* trees. By the fringe of the route, mighty *pam* graze.'

b'Outside the vast metropolis of sin Sm\xc3\xa1ch one can come across horned *chazh*, the national animal of Gut bas Zah. A little closer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the tolling of the mint clock. Ultimately the musk of *sk\xc3\xadp* bushes fills the wind, and a traveller is without a doubt in sin Sm\xc3\xa1ch.'

b'In the Old Quarter of the city, the plazas are paved with sandstone, inlaid with granite. The *sk\xc3\xadp* flowers will be obvious to one. These call to mind the sickness which twenty years ago beset a nearby village. Scholars mill here, laughing. In the early afternoon, a traveller may typically hear the sound of the market-hall clock.'
