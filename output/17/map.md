# b'mo Kauksnen to mo Kaukmut'

## b'mo Spapho'
b'Nearing the outskirts of infamous mo Spapho the traveller will observe the marble tower of the iniquitous market-hall of Paska. Though at such a great distance it seems quaint, the natives of the city find its form repellent, and stay away from it. Slightly closer to the heart of the city, a traveller will hear songs of desolate glee, sung by philosophers of a nearby village. Ultimately the fragrance of *mieshe* plants fills the air, and one has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the prison, the roadways are paved with basalt. A traveller can often hear the gentle song of the *smaupsmi* birds, kept by scholars. In the event that one is so lucky as to come across an argument between two lovers, it can be an afternoon before escape is possible. Artisans mill here, telling stories and laughing. The granite statues which adorn the doorways will be hard to miss. These denote the home of a doctor.'

## b'Stiskiek'
b'Leaving mo Spapho the traveller may go north to Stiskiek. When a traveller crosses the border into mo Kauksku, there is a change in the light, and a bluish cast falls across the countryside. Near the roadside, hairy *keistei* graze. At one point the track crosses a broad valley.'

b'A traveller, outside the gargantuan metropolis of Stiskiek, can encounter a series of fruit-sellers, hawking their wares. A little closer to the centre of the city, one can faintly hear the knell of the bastion clock. In the end the musk of *skusne* fruit fills the wind, and the traveller is undeniably in Stiskiek.'

b'In the Ancient Quarter of the city, the plazas are lined with *mieshe* trees, and the pleasant perfume fills the late morning breeze. Soldiers lounge here, dancing. One may occasionally hear songs of elegiac bliss, sung by writers of the Blue District. Should a traveller be fortunate enough to find the revered Katsnen dance, the traveller may be drawn in, and unable to leave. A traveller will be impressed by the *paki* flowers. These are in memory of the plague which long ago ravaged the surrounding countryside.'

## b'Hohuk Hukho'
b'From Stiskiek the traveller can journey to Hohuk Hukho. The road is long, but scenic, taking two days. *Sheskiem* bushes grow by the track. Along the way the road crosses a broad depression, spotted with *tomshe* trees. As one enters Hinkauk, the foliage changes, giving way to clumps of *mipskei* trees and meadows.'

b'On reaching the walls of the immense city a traveller may catch sight of the monumental temple of Mo Sheispu. Slightly nearer to the heart of the city, one begins to hear the striking of the counting-house clock. At last the smell of *shikmip* bushes fills the air, and the traveller has surely arrived.'

b"In the Actors' Quarter, the boulevards are paved with limestone, inlaid with obsidian. If one is so ill-fated as to see priests praying, it may be an afternoon before escape is possible. Petty criminals swarm here, talking and singing."

## b'Skuhuk'
b'Leaving Hohuk Hukho a traveller may travel south to Skuhuk. The route is crowded, and the journey takes but half a day. *Tomshe* plants grow on the roadside. At one point the track crosses a deep gully, spotted with *hinshe* flowers. When the traveller crosses the border into mo Kaukmut, there is a variation in the light, and a golden cast falls upon the land.'

b'The traveller, near to Skuhuk, can catch sight of citizens, laughing. Somewhat nearer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller will begin to hear songs of joyous dejection, sung by labourers of Skuhuk. Eventually the aroma of *pieho* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller is without a doubt in Skuhuk.'

b'Close to the castle of Stapa, the squares are lined with *tomshe* bushes. The idle rich gather here, trying their luck at *tompih*. The *mieshe* plants will be apparent. These betoken the place of business of an artisan. One can usually hear the delicate song of the *smaupsmi* birds, kept by actors. In the event that the traveller is unfortunate enough to stumble upon a game of *smienshap*, one might be drawn in, and it can be three hours before escape is possible.'
