## b'Utud \xc3\x81kuq'
b'The traveller, on entering immense Utud \xc3\x81kuq, may see the idle rich, singing. Nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller will hear the pleasant song of the *alur* birds, kept by merchants. Eventually the smell of *isid* fruit fills the air, and one is without a doubt in Utud \xc3\x81kuq.'

b"In the Tailors' District, the boulevards are paved with limestone, inlaid with marble. The obsidian figures that decorate the walls will be almost impossible to miss to a traveller. These signify the home of an apothecary. In the late morning, the traveller may often hear the bells of the theatre clock. In the event that one is so fortunate as to catch sight of an altercation between two lovers, it may be a humbling experience. Actors lounge here, practising their skill at *ukam*."

## b'\xc3\x81cut \xc3\xads Utud'
b"Onwards from Utud \xc3\x81kuq a traveller may journey north to \xc3\x81cut \xc3\xads Utud. As the crossing is well-traficked, the traveller can typically find space on a trading ship. The fishermen subsist on a hearty soup made of *uraq* bird meat and seaweed. The taste is nutty, but sweet, enriched by the salty air. The land's edge, a traveller may see flocks of seabirds. In these waters, storms plague craft, but the route is remarkably comfortable."

b"On reaching the edge of the city of \xc3\x81cut \xc3\xads Utud one may espy the mighty counting-house of Amud \xc3\x81tud. From so far, a traveller has no way to make out how criminals avoid it, laughing and dancing. Closer to the centre of the city, the traveller will begin to hear songs of blissful gloom, sung by scholars of the Actors' Quarter. At last the bouquet of *\xc3\xa1d\xc3\xadd* trees fills the breeze, and a traveller has beyond doubt arrived."

b'Close to the temple of \xc3\x81l \xc3\x81tus, the plazas are lined with *aw\xc3\xadb* plants, and the delicate musk fills the late night wind. In the afternoon, one can sometimes hear the pleasant song of the *uxur* birds, kept by farmers. Philosophers teem here, talking. Should the traveller be so unfortunate as to find priests praying, one may be drawn in, and find it hard to escape.'

## b'\xc3\x81kuq \xc3\xads \xc3\x81cut'
b'Leaving \xc3\x81cut \xc3\xads Utud a traveller can go north-west to \xc3\x81kuq \xc3\xads \xc3\x81cut. The traveller can usually charter a small boat. Great numbers of brightly-coloured *\xc3\xadl\xc3\xadg* fish may typically be spotted, leaping from wave to wave. Boats are occasionally beset by squalls near here, but the route is quite safe. Flocks of *urig* birds can often be seen the coast. One may enjoy grilled *\xc3\xadlal* fish, flavoured with *\xc3\xadw\xc3\xa1d* berries, as eaten by sailors and passengers alike. The spicy taste is enchanting, mingling with the salty air.'

b'Near to the infamous city a traveller will stumble upon mighty *asat*, the sacred animal of \xc3\xa1l Ax\xc3\xa1w. A little nearer to the inner parts of the city, one begins to hear the sound of the market-hall clock. Ultimately the fragrance of *usis* fruit fills the air, and the traveller is truly in \xc3\x81kuq \xc3\xads \xc3\x81cut.'

b'In the Temple District of the city, the streets are paved with stone, inlaid with ivory. A traveller will take note of the caged *uraq* birds. These act as a relic of the war which recently troubled the surrounding countryside. If one is blessed enough to come across the famous \xc3\x8dc\xc3\xadq Ud\xc3\xa1w parade, it can be a very instructive experience. Citizens congregate here, trying their luck on the *ukub* board. In the early evening, a traveller may usually hear the balmy song of the *uxur* birds, kept by merchants.'
