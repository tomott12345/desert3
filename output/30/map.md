## b'Tis\xc5\xa1iqu\xc5\xa1iy'
b'A traveller, approaching the outskirts of the infamous city of Tis\xc5\xa1iqu\xc5\xa1iy, can stumble upon scattered silversmiths, hawking their wares. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the chimes of the prison clock. Eventually the aroma of *nissul* flowers fills the wind, and one has undeniably arrived.'

b"In the Artisans' Quarter of the city, the squares are paved with granite, inlaid with sandstone. Should a traveller be so unlucky as to find soldiers laughing, it can be a couple of hours before escape is possible. Labourers throng here, singing. The marble columns which ornament the archways will be conspicuous to the traveller. These function as a memento of the war which in times past beset the city. In the late night, a traveller can often hear the delicate song of the *yaqtisyib\xc5\xa1ulu* birds."

## b'yil-Qu'
b'Leaving Tis\xc5\xa1iqu\xc5\xa1iy one may travel north to yil-Qu. The traveller can sometimes see *yuwkumaw* fish off the stern, barely visible beneath the waves. In these waters, gales usually beset vessels, but the route is extremely easy.'

b'Passing into the colossal metropolis one will see the idle rich, trying their luck at the game of *ghaddur*. Slightly closer to the heart of the city, the traveller begins to hear songs of forlorn joy, sung by merchants of a nearby village. At last the scent of *\xc5\xa1us* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller is without a doubt in yil-Qu.'

b'Close to the theatre, the plazas are lined with *nissul* bushes, and the blue leaves sway in the early evening air. The bourgeoisie lounge here, talking and talking. A distracted visitor will fail to see the *radsudsansasnid* trees. These act to ward off harmful influences. In the late afternoon, the traveller may typically hear the pleasant song of the *ni\xc5\xa1iysit* birds, kept by the idle rich. In the event that one is charmed enough to encounter an argument between two lovers, a traveller might be drawn in, and it may be an afternoon before escape is possible.'
