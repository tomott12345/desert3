# b'Paookieh to Hooeatua'

## b'Hooappiu'
b'The traveller, passing into the city of Hooappiu, may come across priests, dancing and talking. Somewhat closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller will begin to hear the bells of the market-hall clock. Ultimately the bouquet of *noeakeoohiumouh* plants fills the breeze, and the traveller is beyond doubt in Hooappiu.'

b'In the vicinity of the university of Peoupmouik, the plazas are lined with *noeamoua* bushes. Citizens cluster here, trying their luck at *moeatouapioupkieh*. In the event that one is ill-fated enough to see a herd of hairy *muahooouk*, prized for their leather, it can be a very educational experience. The traveller will take note of the *hiuhooakiehhiumoih* stone medallions that decorate the walls. These act to deter harmful influences. One may often hear the clanging of the temple clock.'

## b'Puouthooop'
b'Onwards from Hooappiu a traveller can travel west to Puouthooop. It is a smooth journey. At one point the track crosses a broad valley, spotted with *noeamoua* flowers. When the traveller enters Heompouoon, there is a shift in the quality of the light, and a pale cast falls over the terrain. On the fringe of the road, mighty *muamei* graze.'

b'Approaching the edge of famed Puouthooop one can espy the mighty prison of Nouehpiea. From this distance, a traveller has no way to make out how merchants congregate near its base, singing. Slightly nearer to the centre of the city, the traveller will hear the song of the *teaouhooaphaeatkeaip* birds. Ultimately the perfume of *teaimiahooim* fruit fills the wind, and a traveller is surely in Puouthooop.'

b'In the Red Quarter of the city, the boulevards are paved with lead. The *hieapnoea* plants will be obvious. These act as a memento of the war which twenty years ago tormented a nearby village. Should one be unlucky enough to encounter a fight between two lovers, it can be two hours before escape is possible. The traveller can occasionally hear songs of mournful bliss, sung by the bourgeoisie of Puouthooop.'

## b'Hooappaeat'
b'From Puouthooop a traveller may go to Hooappaeat. Along the way the route crosses a deep canyon, spotted with *noeakeoohiumouh* trees. As the traveller crosses into Hooeatua, there is a change in the quality of the light, and a harsh cast falls across the land.'

b'The traveller, on entering the monstrous metropolis, can find crowds of merchants, hawking their wares. Somewhat closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller begins to hear the gentle song of the *pooattionoue* birds, kept by philosophers. Eventually the smell of *maimouikpuoop* flowers fills the wind, and one has truly arrived.'

b'Around the dancing-hall of Miepueah, the squares are paved with granite. Citizens lounge here, telling stories and praying. A traveller may typically hear the knell of the fortress clock.'
