## b'i\xca\xbb Ikokumen'
b'The traveller, on entering the tremendous city, may see pedlars, setting out their stalls. Nearer to the heart of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the peal of the bastion clock. In the end the perfume of *unawa\xca\xbb* fruit fills the wind, and the traveller is undoubtedly in i\xca\xbb Ikokumen.'

b"In the Fishmongers' Quarter of the city, the alleyways are paved with limestone. Scholars gather here, talking and singing. In the early evening, one can usually hear songs of elegiac delight, sung by philosophers of a nearby village. The *ukalinup* flowers will be almost impossible to miss to a traveller. These denote the place of business of a fortune-teller."

## b'Ak\xc3\xbc\xca\xbbunow'
b"Leaving i\xca\xbb Ikokumen the traveller may go to Ak\xc3\xbc\xca\xbbunow. One may hear *owow\xc3\xbcwap* birds the land's edge, riding the air. Sailors and passengers alike eat a stew made of seaweed and *opeke\xca\xbb* fish, garnished with *elilukim* leaves. The flavour is clean, mingling with the salty air."

b'Near the walls of the famous city of Ak\xc3\xbc\xca\xbbunow a traveller may catch sight of the sandstone spires of the monstrous barbican of Inupuwap. While from so far it seems quaint, the people of the city find its form disagreeable, and shun it. A little closer to the heart of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the balmy song of the *iwipah* birds, kept by petty criminals. Finally the fragrance of *ukalinup* trees fills the breeze, and a traveller is beyond doubt in Ak\xc3\xbc\xca\xbbunow.'

b'Close to the dancing-hall of Oholawo\xca\xbb, the squares are lined with *elilukim* plants. If a traveller is charmed enough to catch sight of writers dancing, it can be an afternoon before escape is possible. Merchants congregate here, telling stories. One may sometimes hear the gentle song of the *iwipah* birds.'
