# b'T\xc3\xa1izlo\xc3\xadp to T\xc3\xa1izgaob'

## b'Naizh\xc3\xa1e'
b'The traveller, nearing the gates of the iniquitous city, may see the golden spires of the famed fortress of S\xc3\xadopr\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa1. From such a great distance, a traveller has no way to make out how writers cluster by it, praying. Somewhat nearer to the centre of the city, one will hear songs of merry melancholy, sung by labourers of Naizh\xc3\xa1e. Eventually the smell of *liucha\xc3\xa1* trees fills the air, and the traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b"In the Artisans' District of the city, the roadways are paved with stone, inlaid with marble. In the event that a traveller is blessed enough to catch sight of a fight between two lovers, it may be a very humbling experience. In the early afternoon, the traveller may typically hear the striking of the palace clock."

## b'Ch\xc3\xa1enaon'
b'Onwards from Naizh\xc3\xa1e one can journey north-east to Ch\xc3\xa1enaon. It is an enjoyable journey. On the roadside, mighty *pa\xc3\xadlo\xc3\xadp* graze. When a traveller crosses the border into P\xc3\xa1\xc3\xadt\xc3\xa1iz, there is a shift in the quality of the light, and a bluish cast falls across the landscape. Along the way the route crosses a deep canyon, spotted with *gaobmuezh* flowers.'

b'Entering Ch\xc3\xa1enaon the traveller may find artisans, trying their luck on the *shu\xc3\xa9ch\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1* court. Slightly closer to the heart of the city, one will begin to hear the gentle song of the *seinlait* birds, kept by farmers. Ultimately the perfume of *naonm\xc3\xa9a* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller has beyond doubt arrived.'

b'Near the citadel of Zierl\xc3\xa9et, the alleyways are paved with *laitzo\xc3\xad* stone, inlaid with granite. The tame *seinlait* birds will be easy to see. These call to mind the pestilence which twenty years ago tormented the New Quarter. If the traveller is so ill-fated as to stumble upon the famous Ch\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1cha\xc3\xa1g dance, a traveller might be drawn in, and it may be half a day before escape is possible. In the late evening, one may occasionally hear the tolling of the temple clock. Priests lounge here, talking and dancing.'

## b'Zh\xc3\xa1elo\xc3\xadp'
b'From Ch\xc3\xa1enaon a traveller may go south-west to Zh\xc3\xa1elo\xc3\xadp. It is a delightful journey. *Cha\xc3\xa1naon* plants grow by the road. At one point the track crosses a deep ravine. As the traveller enters T\xc3\xa1izgaob, the foliage changes, giving way to scrubland and open fields.'

b'A traveller, at the walls of the city of Zh\xc3\xa1elo\xc3\xadp, will espy the diamond dome of the celebrated mint of Zu\xc3\xadl\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1. Somewhat nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the pleasant song of the *m\xc3\xa1er\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa1* birds. In the end the aroma of *gaobmuezh* bushes fills the wind, and one is truly in Zh\xc3\xa1elo\xc3\xadp.'

b'In the Ancient District, the back-streets are lined with *cha\xc3\xa1naon* plants. Should the traveller be charmed enough to see a game of *shu\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1*, it can be an afternoon before escape is possible. Citizens mill here, practising their skill at the game of *shu\xc3\xa9ru\xc3\xa1*.'
