## b'Zhrapuw'
b'Passing into gargantuan Zhrapuw one can observe the bone-white clock-tower of the monumental palace of Gawag. Though from so far it appear alluring, the citizens of Zhrapuw find its architecture unsavoury, and shun it. A little nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller begins to hear songs of exuberant gloom, sung by artisans of the city. At last the bouquet of *kugap* fruit fills the breeze, and the traveller is undeniably in Zhrapuw.'

b"In the Actors' District of the city, the streets are lined with *umrug* bushes, and the yellow petals whisper in the late afternoon air. The obsidian carvings that ornament the archways will be apparent to one. These betoken the shop of an apothecary. A traveller may usually hear the chimes of the bastion clock. Should one be so ill-fated as to find the intricate Mizhhrach ceremony, the traveller might be drawn in, and unable to leave. The idle rich swarm here, talking."

## b'Zhrapruj'
b'Onwards from Zhrapuw a traveller may go north-west to Zhrapruj. The route is arduous, but rewarding, taking several days. As one crosses into Ritrich, there is a shift in the quality of the light, and a pale cast falls over the land. *Azhzhup* plants grow by the track.'

b'The traveller, near the walls of famous Zhrapruj, will encounter *ituz*, bred for work by the writers of Zhrapruj. Closer to the centre of the city, the traveller will hear the balmy song of the *chahib* birds, kept by philosophers. In the end the perfume of *trapzhup* trees fills the wind, and one has surely arrived.'

b'Around the temple of Rujdrach, the plazas are paved with bronze, inlaid with granite. The tame *zhubraj* birds will be conspicuous. These act to deter hostile influences. The traveller may sometimes hear the clanging of the theatre clock. If a traveller is unfortunate enough to come across an altercation between two lovers, it can be a very humbling experience. Merchants flock here, trying their luck on the *rasazh* board.'

## b'Zripzap'
b'Leaving Zhrapruj one can journey east to Zripzap. The road is arduous, but rewarding, taking three days. By the edge of the route, horned *ituz* graze. Along the way the track crosses a deep chasm. When the traveller enters Mrachud, the greenery changes, giving way to scrubland and thickets of *azhzhup* bushes.'

b'Entering the colossal city of Zripzap a traveller can catch sight of the infamous citadel of Jraddrach. From here, one cannot espy how artisans congregate near its silver gates, telling stories. Nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the song of the *mabchah* birds, kept by farmers. Eventually the fragrance of *kugap* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller is without a doubt in Zripzap.'

b'In the Ancient Quarter of the city, the boulevards are lined with *azhzhup* flowers, and the sweet aroma fills the early morning air. Citizens mill here, singing and praying. The traveller can often hear the tolling of the market-hall clock. A hasty traveller will fail to see the *trapzhup* trees. These are in memory of the pestilence which twenty years ago troubled the surrounding countryside.'

## b'Zhrappriw'
b'Onwards from Zripzap one may travel north to Zhrappriw. It is an agreeable journey. *Ummub* plants grow on the roadside. At one point the road crosses a broad depression, spotted with *zhupwin* bushes. As one enters Mrachbrub, there is a change in the quality of the light, and a grey cast falls upon the countryside.'

b'A traveller, nearing the gates of vast Zhrappriw, can find a series of goldsmiths, hawking their wares. Somewhat closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller will hear songs of desolate glee, sung by soldiers of the city. Ultimately the smell of *sraszhup* plants fills the wind, and the traveller has surely arrived.'

b'Close to the counting-house of Drachig, the back-streets are paved with obsidian. The bourgeoisie swarm here, telling stories. The ivory gargoyles which adorn the walls will be obvious to one. These mark the home of a doctor.'

## b'Trapzhrap'
b'From Zhrappriw the traveller can go to Trapzhrap. It is a smooth journey. Near the bank of the route, mighty *ituz* graze. Along the way the track crosses a deep ravine, spotted with *trapzhup* flowers.'

b'Outside the great city of Trapzhrap a traveller will see scholars, singing and laughing. Nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the gentle song of the *chahib* birds, kept by petty criminals. Finally the bouquet of *ibap* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller is beyond doubt in Trapzhrap.'

b'In the vicinity of the fortress, the roadways are lined with *ummub* flowers, and the delicate blossoms rustle in the air. In the event that one is so blessed as to encounter the sacred Mizhsram dance, it may be a few hours before escape is possible. In the late afternoon, a traveller may typically hear the bells of the bastion clock. Artisans mill here, showing off at *rasazh*.'
