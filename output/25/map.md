# b'Shozhchuzh to Belshesh'

## b'Sorub Ubchoz'
b'The traveller, on reaching the outskirts of the colossal city, will see crowds of fishmongers, setting out their stalls. A little nearer to the inner parts of the city, one begins to hear the peal of the citadel clock. In the end the scent of *ugkuzh* flowers fills the wind, and one has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'In the Red District, the squares are paved with granite, inlaid with marble. A traveller will be inspired by the stone columns that ornament the eaves. These are a deterrent to unwanted influences. In the late afternoon, the traveller can occasionally hear the sweet song of the *dozsup* birds, kept by merchants. Should a traveller be fortunate enough to come across a game of *shushoz*, it may be a very instructive experience.'

## b'Umsor'
b'Leaving Sorub Ubchoz the traveller can journey south to Umsor. It is an enjoyable journey. Horned *ushlozh* graze on the edge of the track. Along the way the route crosses a broad valley, spotted with *eshtus* trees. As one enters Orshom, the vegetation changes, giving way to open fields and pastures.'

b'Near to Umsor the traveller can see petty criminals, talking. Slightly closer to the heart of the city, a traveller will begin to hear songs of sorrowful bliss, sung by citizens of the city. At last the fragrance of *uzsuz* fruit fills the wind, and one has beyond doubt arrived.'

b'Around the castle of Om Bumuch, the plazas are paved with obsidian, inlaid with bronze. The granite statues which adorn the archways will be difficult to miss. These signify the place of business of an apothecary. The bourgeoisie swarm here, praying and laughing. In the early night, the traveller may typically hear the clanging of the fortress clock.'

## b'Edezh'
b'From Umsor one may go to Edezh. The traveller can often find space on a small trading ship. Near the side of the boat a traveller can sometimes see great numbers of vermillion fish, barely visible beneath the surf. The crossing is very comfortable, notwithstanding the foul weather conditions which occasionally trouble vessels near here.'

b'A traveller, at the walls of the monumental metropolis, can make out the limestone lookout of the monstrous prison of Suchbum. A little closer to the inner parts of the city, one will hear songs of ecstatic melancholy, sung by artisans of the Grey Quarter. Finally the smell of *eshtus* bushes fills the breeze, and the traveller is without a doubt in Edezh.'

b'Close to the barbican of Bumuk Suchep, the streets are lined with *eshtus* plants, and the emerald leaves shimmer in the early afternoon wind. In the event that a traveller is so unfortunate as to come across soldiers singing, it may be an afternoon before escape is possible. In the late evening, one may sometimes hear the gentle song of the *dozsup* birds, kept by priests. One will notice the caged *zhebmuk* birds. These act as a memento of the war which recently engulfed Edezh.'

## b'Sekezh'
b'Leaving Edezh a traveller can travel to Sekezh. When the traveller crosses the border into Shozhkozh, there is a shift in the quality of the light, and a harsh cast falls over the landscape. At one point the track crosses a deep chasm. By the roadside, *tusez* trees grow.'

b'Passing into the city of Sekezh a traveller will observe the mighty mint of Epshesh. Nearer to the centre of the city, one will begin to hear the knell of the bastion clock. Ultimately the scent of *uzsuz* fruit fills the air, and the traveller is truly in Sekezh.'

b'In the Ancient District of the city, the alleyways are paved with basalt. If one is blessed enough to find an argument between two lovers, a traveller might be drawn in, and it may be three hours before escape is possible. The *tusez* flowers will be apparent. These mark the shop of a smith.'

## b'Pulezh'
b'From Sekezh the traveller may go north to Pulezh. A traveller can usually obtain passage on a fishing boat. One may enjoy boiled *ugkuzh* fruit, spiced with *ozhtus* berries, as eaten by the crew. In the water nearby *zuzhed* fish can typically be seen, gleaming in the sunlight. Flocks of seabirds may occasionally be observed the coast, circling overhead.'

b'A traveller, nearing the edge of Pulezh, may catch sight of scattered fruit-sellers, hawking their wares. Somewhat closer to the heart of the city, a traveller can faintly hear songs of doleful glee, sung by philosophers of the city. In the end the fragrance of *suchkus* fruit fills the breeze, and the traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the theatre of Ukuch Epozh, the boulevards are lined with *eshtus* bushes. A hasty visitor will fail to see the limestone carvings that decorate the balustrades. These repel hostile influences. Should one be so lucky as to stumble upon a herd of *chozop*, bred for work by the labourers of the surrounding countryside, it can be half a day before escape is possible. In the early afternoon, the traveller can usually hear the delicate song of the *dozshod* birds, kept by petty criminals. Writers flock here, trying their luck at the game of *shushoz*.'

## b'om Obnot'
b'Onwards from Pulezh a traveller may journey north-west to om Obnot. One can occasionally find space on a small vessel. The sailors subsist on a thin broth made of *zuzhed* fish and *ordoz* bird meat, flavoured with *ozhtus* flowers. There are typically shoals of silver fish off the bow. True the coast flocks of *zhebmuk* birds can sometimes be spotted, riding the wind. Boats are tormented by squalls in this area, but the route is extremely pleasant.'

b'On entering the vast city the traveller can see the jade tower of the colossal temple of Shushbum. From here, a traveller is unable to espy how soldiers congregate around its obsidian gates, talking. Slightly nearer to the inner parts of the city, one begins to hear the pleasant song of the *dozshod* birds, kept by the idle rich. At last the perfume of *eshtus* trees fills the air, and the traveller is without a doubt in om Obnot.'

b"In the Artisans' Quarter, the squares are lined with *tusek* plants, and the gentle aroma fills the late night breeze. Merchants gather here, dancing and telling stories. In the event that a traveller is unfortunate enough to come across a fight between two lovers, the traveller may be drawn in, and unable to leave. One can sometimes hear the striking of the dancing-hall clock. The tame *zhebmuk* birds will be obvious to one. These commemorate the revolution which not long ago tormented the Blue District."
