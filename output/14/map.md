# b'us Ajas to Agung Avasij'

## b'Aging Ijis'
b'Entering infamous Aging Ijis a traveller will make out the iniquitous prison of Unakuv. Although from here it may look beautiful, the citizens of Aging Ijis find its bulk disagreeable, and avoid it. A little closer to the centre of the city, one can faintly hear songs of desolate ecstasy, sung by scholars of the Ancient District. Ultimately the perfume of *uqumuv* fruit fills the air, and a traveller is undoubtedly in Aging Ijis.'

b'In the Old Quarter of the city, the alleyways are paved with *avilir* stone. The idle rich lounge here, trying their luck on the *atukup* board. In the event that the traveller is unlucky enough to encounter an argument between two lovers, it can be two hours before escape is possible. In the early morning, one may typically hear songs of gleeful melancholy, sung by petty criminals of the surrounding countryside.'

## b'us Aging'
b'Leaving Aging Ijis a traveller may travel north to us Aging. The route is well-trodden, and the journey takes but an afternoon. When the traveller enters Asujar, the foliage changes, giving way to scrubland and open fields. By the track, *utuvam* flowers grow. Along the way the road crosses a deep gully, spotted with *ujunuv* bushes.'

b'The traveller, on reaching the edge of the great city of us Aging, can come across *uran*, valued for their milk. Slightly closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller begins to hear the sweet song of the *irung* birds. At last the fragrance of *utimam* plants fills the wind, and the traveller has surely arrived.'

b'Close to the barbican, the back-streets are lined with *ujunuv* flowers, and the blue blossoms rustle in the late evening breeze. In the early night, one can often hear the striking of the dancing-hall clock. The tame *itiqung* birds will be obvious to the traveller. These act as a reminder of the revolution which in times past engulfed a nearby village. Should one be so blessed as to catch sight of the famous Agaj Anim procession, a traveller might be drawn in, and find it difficult to escape.'

## b'Isijav'
b'From us Aging one can journey to Isijav. It is an enjoyable journey. At one point the route crosses a broad depression, spotted with *ijamag* bushes. *Aqanip* graze on the roadside. As the traveller crosses the border into Agung Avasij, the greenery changes, giving way to meadows and wild *amaj* flowers.'

b'Passing into the celebrated city a traveller can stumble upon priests, showing off at *ugit*. Somewhat nearer to the centre of the city, the traveller will hear the peal of the castle clock. In the end the bouquet of *uqumuv* fruit fills the wind, and a traveller is truly in Isijav.'

b"In the Merchants' District, the streets are lined with *uluv* plants. Farmers mill here, singing. In the late morning, one may typically hear songs of sombre exuberance, sung by criminals of the Grey Quarter. An inattentive observer will fail to see the sandstone medallions which grace the lintels. These commemorate the pestilence which not long ago beset Isijav."
