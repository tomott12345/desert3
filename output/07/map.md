# b'Pumaku to Sipulotesa'

## b'Pesasosoti'
b'On entering the monumental city the traveller can make out the sandstone towers of the colossal bastion of Mipameti. Slightly nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller begins to hear the song of the *tipipelu* birds. At last the musk of *lomuponepu* fruit fills the wind, and one is without a doubt in Pesasosoti.'

b'Near the citadel, the roadways are lined with *saputilule* plants. If one is so blessed as to encounter a herd of shaggy *kosimimesi*, beloved for their meat, it may be a most edifying experience. The traveller may usually hear the tolling of the theatre clock. The *tipole* trees will be obvious to a traveller. These betoken the workplace of an apothecary.'

## b'Pepati'
b'From Pesasosoti one can go north-west to Pepati. It is an enjoyable journey. When a traveller enters Molosipole, there is a variation in the light, and a pale cast falls upon the countryside. Near the verge of the track, *milepo* bushes grow.'

b'A traveller, near the outskirts of mighty Pepati, can find philosophers, trying their luck at *lotelo*. Somewhat closer to the heart of the city, the traveller can faintly hear songs of blissful melancholy, sung by writers of the surrounding countryside. Finally the perfume of *pesekosile* plants fills the air, and one has truly arrived.'

b"In the Merchants' District of the city, the boulevards are paved with granite, inlaid with obsidian. In the event that a traveller is so lucky as to see scholars laughing, it can be half a day before escape is possible. A hasty visitor will fail to see the *saputilule* flowers. These commemorate the pestilence which long ago devastated a nearby village. In the early morning, the traveller can often hear the chimes of the fortress clock."

## b'pi-Pupata'
b'Leaving Pepati one may journey south-west to pi-Pupata. At one point the road crosses a broad valley, spotted with *sapemiki* trees. As the traveller crosses the border into Sipulotesa, the vegetation changes, giving way to pastures and open fields. By the roadside, *pupeleki* bushes grow.'

b'Near to the city of pi-Pupata a traveller may see the chryselephantine spires of the tremendous counting-house of Pi-Kupapo. From so far, one has no way to espy how farmers stay away from it, singing. A little closer to the centre of the city, the traveller will begin to hear songs of forlorn bliss, sung by citizens of pi-Pupata. In the end the bouquet of *tipole* plants fills the breeze, and a traveller has surely arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the palace of Mutisunipa, the streets are lined with *saputilule* trees, and the gentle smell fills the night wind. One will be impressed by the marble medallions that grace the rooftops. These are a warning to harmful influences. In the late morning, a traveller may sometimes hear the balmy song of the *tipipelu* birds, kept by labourers. Should the traveller be ill-fated enough to find a game of *lomonopu*, a traveller may be drawn in, and unable to leave.'
