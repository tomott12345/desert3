# b'Tebgum to Tebset'

## b'sim Zozh'
b'A traveller, near the walls of celebrated sim Zozh, may observe the glistening towers of the iniquitous citadel of Hijbikjum. Even though from such a great distance it seems beautiful, the denizens of the city find its bulk unsavoury, and steer clear of it. Closer to the centre of the city, the traveller will hear songs of melancholy ecstasy, sung by petty criminals of the surrounding countryside. At last the perfume of *tit* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the watchtower of Bikkekhuum, the squares are lined with *zhazhbikjow* trees, and the balmy scent fills the late evening air. One will see the lead medallions which grace the doorways. These function as a warning to evil influences. In the afternoon, a traveller can usually hear the song of the *mobbopchuuh* birds, kept by soldiers. In the event that the traveller is fortunate enough to encounter labourers talking, it may be a most instructive experience. The idle rich teem here, praying and singing.'

## b'Gumhuumzozh'
b'Onwards from sim Zozh a traveller may go north to Gumhuumzozh. As one enters Hohtebbop, the vegetation changes, giving way to copses of *bigzhazhchuuh* bushes and scrubland. Along the way the road crosses a broad rift.'

b'Entering the city a traveller will stumble upon crowds of hawkers, setting out their stalls. Slightly nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller begins to hear songs of ecstatic melancholy, sung by philosophers of a nearby village. In the end the bouquet of *nepgum* plants fills the wind, and one is undeniably in Gumhuumzozh.'

b'Near the university of Hijbig, the roadways are paved with ivory. If the traveller is so lucky as to see a herd of shaggy *hozbokzin*, bred for work by the the bourgeoisie of the city, it can be three hours before escape is possible. In the early morning, a traveller may occasionally hear the peal of the barbican clock. An inattentive observer will fail to see the *hoztoch* flowers. These serve to deter hostile influences. Priests lounge here, dancing.'

## b'Dohsetkaw'
b'From Gumhuumzozh one can travel to Dohsetkaw. At one point the route crosses a deep canyon. When the traveller crosses the border into Tebset, there is a change in the quality of the light, and a bluish cast falls across the land.'

b'A traveller, at the outskirts of the tremendous city of Dohsetkaw, will discern the crystal tower of the famed dancing-hall of Kaw bob Hij. From here, one is unable to see how farmers crowd around its walls, showing off on the *nad* tables. Closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear songs of heavy-hearted bliss, sung by philosophers of a nearby village. Eventually the fragrance of *titjum* fruit fills the air, and the traveller has surely arrived.'

b"In the Artisans' Quarter of the city, the squares are lined with *bigzhazhchuuh* bushes, and the yellow leaves whisper in the early evening breeze. Should one be blessed enough to find a quarrel between two lovers, a traveller might be drawn in, and unable to leave. Writers gather here, talking and praying. The traveller can typically hear the sweet song of the *dut* birds."
