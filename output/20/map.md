# b'Simpispim to Saltelnop'

## b'Sokmil'
b'On reaching the edge of the city of Sokmil the traveller may discern the golden spires of the monumental barbican of Tanpak. From so far, one cannot see how writers shun it, practising their skill at *pelnik*. Slightly nearer to the centre of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the delicate song of the *metponnuk* birds, kept by the bourgeoisie. Finally the musk of *muntillon* fruit fills the air, and the traveller is undoubtedly in Sokmil.'

b"In the Goldsmiths' District of the city, the streets are lined with *lonkaknop* plants, and the sweet fragrance fills the afternoon breeze. One can often hear songs of exuberant dejection, sung by artisans of the surrounding countryside. The idle rich throng here, dancing. If a traveller is so unfortunate as to come across a game of *pelnik*, it may be an instructive experience."

## b'Sokkes'
b'Leaving Sokmil the traveller can journey south-west to Sokkes. It is a simple journey. *Saplik* bushes grow by the roadside. At one point the track crosses a broad depression. When one enters Saltelnop, the vegetation changes, giving way to hedgerows and pastures.'

b'A traveller, outside the famous city, will stumble upon *napnelmun*, the national animal of Saltelnop. A little closer to the heart of the city, the traveller will hear the song of the *toppip* birds. Eventually the smell of *mippullot* trees fills the wind, and a traveller has beyond doubt arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the citadel of Pap-Lolpot, the back-streets are lined with *punmim* flowers. In the event that one is lucky enough to encounter the holy Lokpoppis ritual, a traveller may be drawn in, and it may be half a day before escape is possible. Philosophers gather here, talking and praying. A careless visitor will not notice the limestone gargoyles that ornament the rooftops. These function as a caution to hostile influences. In the night, a traveller may typically hear the striking of the mint clock.'
