# b'Tup hiz Gub to Jas hiz Giud'

## b'Sab Pip'
b'At the outskirts of the metropolis of Sab Pip a traveller will find fishmongers, setting out their stalls. A little closer to the heart of the city, one can faintly hear the chimes of the barbican clock. Finally the bouquet of *kub* trees fills the wind, and the traveller has undeniably arrived.'

b'In the Green District of the city, the streets are paved with stone, inlaid with *tschuab* stone. Priests throng here, telling stories. If the traveller is ill-fated enough to catch sight of a herd of shaggy *biaz*, the sacred animal of Tup hiz Gub, it may be a most edifying experience. In the early evening, one may typically hear songs of hopeful melancholy, sung by the bourgeoisie of the city.'

## b'tud Sih Kud'
b'Onwards from Sab Pip a traveller can journey west to tud Sih Kud. It is an agreeable journey. By the verge of the route, *bim* graze. As one crosses into Gub hiz Zub, the greenery changes, giving way to open fields and scrubland.'

b'A traveller, passing into the immense city, will discern the great university of Nis hiz Ban. From here, a traveller is unable to espy how scholars teem around it, showing off on the *waut* court. A little closer to the centre of the city, the traveller will hear the peal of the temple clock. In the end the musk of *wuik* bushes fills the air, and a traveller is truly in tud Sih Kud.'

b'Around the fortress of Hatsch Bis, the alleyways are paved with obsidian, inlaid with stone. A hasty observer will miss the caged *gim* birds. These serve as a deterrent to malign spirits. Should one be so fortunate as to encounter a quarrel between two lovers, it may be an afternoon before escape is possible. Actors flock here, dancing and laughing. In the late afternoon, one can sometimes hear the balmy song of the *gim* birds, kept by merchants.'

## b'Sab Pautsch'
b'Leaving tud Sih Kud a traveller may go west to Sab Pautsch. *Puts* flowers grow near the road. Along the way the route crosses a deep chasm.'

b'Near the gates of Sab Pautsch the traveller may catch sight of the jade dome of the colossal mint of Dab hiz Nis. While from so far it may appear beautiful, denizens of Sab Pautsch find its architecture obscene, and hide from it. Slightly nearer to the heart of the city, one begins to hear songs of forlorn joy, sung by writers of the Old Quarter. At last the fragrance of *duiz* fruit fills the wind, and a traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b"In the Artisans' District of the city, the roadways are lined with *wuik* trees, and the golden blossoms whisper in the late night air. If a traveller is so lucky as to stumble upon the intricate Tiz Sim ceremony, the traveller might be drawn in, and find it tricky to escape. Artisans mill here, singing. In the early morning, one can usually hear the pleasant song of the *gim* birds, kept by the idle rich. The tame *guitsch* birds will be clear. These mark the shop of a smith."
