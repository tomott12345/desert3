## b'Unk\xc3\xbctl\xc3\xbct'
b'Entering celebrated Unk\xc3\xbctl\xc3\xbct a traveller will catch sight of the crystal clock-tower of the tremendous fortress of It Kospl\xc3\xa4n. Somewhat closer to the centre of the city, the traveller will hear the tolling of the market-hall clock. In the end the scent of *r\xc3\xbcket* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller has undeniably arrived.'

b"In the Goldsmiths' District, the back-streets are paved with lead. In the event that the traveller is lucky enough to see citizens dancing, one might be drawn in, and unable to leave. In the late night, a traveller may occasionally hear the pleasant song of the *tisittrotop* birds, kept by the bourgeoisie. Writers gather here, talking and dancing. The basalt medallions which adorn the archways will be conspicuous to the traveller. These denote the home of a doctor."

## b'N\xc3\xa4momlumt\xc3\xb6p'
b'Leaving Unk\xc3\xbctl\xc3\xbct a traveller can go west to N\xc3\xa4momlumt\xc3\xb6p. As many ships cross these waters, one can typically charter a small fishing vessel. The traveller may enjoy salted *muttrotop* bird meat, flavoured with *sr\xc3\xbcpn\xc3\xa4mn\xc3\xbcl* seed, as eaten by both sailors and passengers. Near here, craft are troubled by bad weather conditions, but the route is easy. By the side of the boat a traveller can usually see great numbers of iridescent *atn\xc3\xbcnotnop* fish, darting through the water.'

b'The traveller, at the outskirts of the iniquitous metropolis, may catch sight of a series of hawkers, setting out their stalls. Slightly nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the bells of the dancing-hall clock. At last the aroma of *sr\xc3\xbcp* bushes fills the breeze, and a traveller is beyond doubt in N\xc3\xa4momlumt\xc3\xb6p.'

b'In the vicinity of the counting-house of R\xc3\xbcp \xc3\x84k, the streets are lined with *lelt\xc3\xb6pn\xc3\xbcl* flowers, and the red petals rustle in the morning air. In the early evening, one can occasionally hear songs of gleeful sadness, sung by the idle rich of the Ancient Quarter. If the traveller is so fortunate as to find a herd of hairy *krilen*, the sacred animal of Okt\xc3\xa4m t\xc3\xbct Ok, it may be half a day before escape is possible. Criminals swarm here, showing off at *tlon*. An inattentive observer will overlook the *sr\xc3\xbcp* trees. These are a reminder of the plague which in times past troubled the surrounding countryside.'

## b'N\xc3\xa4mesp\xc3\xb6tpl\xc3\xa4n'
b'From N\xc3\xa4momlumt\xc3\xb6p a traveller may journey south to N\xc3\xa4mesp\xc3\xb6tpl\xc3\xa4n. There are usually, in the water nearby, numerous vividly striped *trutk\xc3\xbctr\xc3\xa4p* fish, barely visible beneath the surface. Crew and passengers alike eat a piquant broth made of seaweed and turtle meat, flavoured with *\xc3\xa4t* flowers. The taste is rich, enriched by the salty air.'

b'Outside the famous city of N\xc3\xa4mesp\xc3\xb6tpl\xc3\xa4n one can observe the immense mint of \xc3\x84kr\xc3\xa4p. From here, the traveller is unable to discern how the bourgeoisie teem by it, singing. Somewhat closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the chimes of the market-hall clock. In the end the bouquet of *r\xc3\xbcket* fruit fills the breeze, and one has surely arrived.'

b"In the Fishmongers' District of the city, the roadways are paved with granite, inlaid with ivory. The traveller will notice the limestone columns that ornament the doorways. These indicate the place of business of an artisan. In the late morning, one may sometimes hear the delicate song of the *tlestuppl\xc3\xa4nl\xc3\xbct* birds, kept by priests. Should a traveller be unfortunate enough to catch sight of merchants laughing, it may be a very edifying experience. Scholars throng here, talking and praying."

## b'Sr\xc3\xb6nlut'
b'Onwards from N\xc3\xa4mesp\xc3\xb6tpl\xc3\xa4n the traveller can journey to Sr\xc3\xb6nlut. As the crossing is well-traficked, one can typically obtain passage on a trading boat. Shoals of brightly-coloured *moltattrut\xc3\xb6t* fish may often be observed near the side of the boat, shining in the sunlight. Even though the route is extremely comfortable, gales usually beset boats in these waters. A traveller will enjoy grilled *t\xc3\xa4miktupl\xc3\xbct* bird meat, garnished with *\xc3\xa4t* leaves, as eaten by the fishermen. The bitter flavour is delicious, mingling with the salty air.'

b'A traveller, on reaching the gates of the vast city of Sr\xc3\xb6nlut, can see labourers, trying their luck on the *tlon* field. A little nearer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller begins to hear songs of doleful pleasure, sung by priests of a nearby village. Ultimately the musk of *et* fruit fills the air, and one is without a doubt in Sr\xc3\xb6nlut.'

b'Close to the bastion of \xc3\x96ttlot \xc3\x84k, the boulevards are paved with basalt, inlaid with marble. The caged *n\xc3\xbcpl\xc3\xbcttupt\xc3\xb6p* birds will be apparent to the traveller. These call to mind the pestilence which in times past engulfed the city. In the early afternoon, a traveller can occasionally hear the clanging of the university clock.'

## b'r\xc3\xbcp Lumn\xc3\xa4l'
b'Leaving Sr\xc3\xb6nlut one can go north-east to r\xc3\xbcp Lumn\xc3\xa4l. Many vessels traffic these waters, so a traveller can usually find space on a small trading ship. Crew and passengers alike snack on a piquant soup made of *sr\xc3\xbcpn\xc3\xa4mn\xc3\xbcl* fruit and *trutk\xc3\xbctr\xc3\xa4p* fish, spiced with *sr\xc3\xbcplut* berries. The taste is nutty, but sour, enriched by the salty air. The crossing is surprisingly pleasant, despite the squalls. There are sometimes *atn\xc3\xbcnotnop* fish by the side of the boat, leaping from wave to wave.'

b'The traveller, passing into the city, will espy the celebrated palace of Mr\xc3\xb6kotlas. Closer to the heart of the city, one will begin to hear the gentle song of the *muttrotop* birds, kept by actors. Finally the fragrance of *\xc3\xa4t* plants fills the wind, and the traveller has undeniably arrived.'

b'Near the castle, the alleyways are lined with *sr\xc3\xbcp* flowers, and the balmy musk fills the late evening air. In the early afternoon, one may occasionally hear the song of the *t\xc3\xa4miktupl\xc3\xbct* birds, kept by farmers. In the event that a traveller is so ill-fated as to find a game of *tlon*, the traveller may be drawn in, and find it almost impossible to escape. The sandstone figures which grace the lintels will be conspicuous to a traveller. These serve as a deterrent to malign spirits.'
