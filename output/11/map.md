# b'Pap-Nom to Num-Muus'

## b'Pakmun'
b'The traveller, passing into immense Pakmun, will espy the mighty palace of Sat-Kam. Slightly nearer to the centre of the city, one can faintly hear the bells of the temple clock. Finally the scent of *nen* fruit fills the wind, and the traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b'Near the theatre, the plazas are paved with bronze, inlaid with basalt. If a traveller is so lucky as to catch sight of a herd of *pos*, bred for work by the actors of the surrounding countryside, one may be drawn in, and it may be a few hours before escape is possible. The granite columns that ornament the walls will be easy to see. These are in memory of the revolution which long ago troubled the Grey District. Priests swarm here, telling stories and laughing. In the early afternoon, the traveller may sometimes hear the pleasant song of the *min* birds.'

## b'Numpom'
b'From Pakmun a traveller may go north-east to Numpom. The road is arduous, but scenic, taking two days. Near the roadside, hairy *tumlam* graze. When the traveller enters Nom-Naspam, the greenery changes, giving way to open fields and wild *sennup* flowers. At one point the track crosses a broad rift, spotted with *timnon* trees.'

b'Near the walls of the city of Numpom a traveller can find merchants, praying. A little closer to the inner parts of the city, one will hear songs of sorrowful joy, sung by soldiers of the city. Eventually the aroma of *nuppap* plants fills the air, and a traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b"In the Actors' Quarter, the streets are lined with *nunsam* flowers, and the gentle fragrance fills the late morning air. In the evening, one can occasionally hear the knell of the counting-house clock. An inattentive observer will miss the *sennup* bushes. These betoken the shop of an artisan. Citizens lounge here, trying their luck at the game of *nutnas*. In the event that the traveller is charmed enough to come across a quarrel between two lovers, it can be an educational experience."

## b'Pummum'
b'Onwards from Numpom a traveller can travel west to Pummum. As the traveller crosses the border into Mutmuun, there is a variation in the quality of the light, and a pale cast falls upon the landscape. *Tim* trees grow on the verge of the route. Along the way the road crosses a deep gorge.'

b"A traveller, near to the vast metropolis, can see shaggy *kin*, the national animal of Mutmuun. Somewhat closer to the heart of the city, a traveller will begin to hear songs of hopeful misery, sung by the idle rich of the Tailors' District. Ultimately the bouquet of *nen* fruit fills the wind, and one is surely in Pummum."

b'In the vicinity of the citadel of Sekpap, the alleyways are lined with *nuppap* plants, and the golden petals shimmer in the breeze. Priests teem here, talking. The tame *mem* birds will be conspicuous to one. These function as a caution to unwanted influences. If the traveller is unlucky enough to stumble upon a game of *nutmus*, it can be half a day before escape is possible.'

## b'Pommus'
b'Leaving Pummum a traveller may journey north to Pommus. Near the track, *sennup* flowers grow. At one point the route crosses a broad valley. As a traveller crosses the border into Sat-Lonpuum, the vegetation changes, giving way to groves of *nupmip* trees and meadows.'

b'At the gates of the monumental city of Pommus one can catch sight of the monstrous barbican of Seklon. Even though from here it appear beautiful, the natives of Pommus find its bulk disagreeable, and stay away from it. A little nearer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the chimes of the university clock. In the end the aroma of *tim* bushes fills the air, and one has undeniably arrived.'

b'In the Ancient Quarter of the city, the squares are paved with ivory, inlaid with obsidian. In the event that a traveller is so unfortunate as to encounter the intricate Punmus dance, one might be drawn in, and unable to leave. Farmers crowd here, dancing and laughing. A careless traveller will not notice the marble medallions which grace the archways. These are a relic of the plague which in times past devastated a nearby village.'

## b'Muus-Lonpuum'
b'From Pommus the traveller can travel to Muus-Lonpuum. The road is busy, and the journey takes but an afternoon. *Tumlam* graze by the edge of the track. When a traveller enters Mangpap, there is a change in the light, and a grey cast falls across the countryside. Along the way the route crosses a deep ravine, spotted with *nuppap* trees.'

b'The traveller, outside Muus-Lonpuum, may see the gargantuan watchtower of Sin-Kammun. At such a great distance, one cannot observe how artisans avoid it, praying. Somewhat closer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller begins to hear the sweet song of the *min* birds, kept by actors. At last the smell of *puk* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller is truly in Muus-Lonpuum.'

b'Around the market-hall of Nulnon, the streets are paved with *masnam* stone, inlaid with granite. The caged *mem* birds will be hard to miss to one. These warn off malign spirits. Citizens gather here, singing and laughing. Should the traveller be so blessed as to find a game of *kenglam*, it may be half a day before escape is possible. In the late night, a traveller may sometimes hear songs of plaintive bliss, sung by scholars of the city.'

## b'Paklon'
b'Onwards from Muus-Lonpuum one may go north-west to Paklon. It is a pleasant journey. On the roadside, *tim* flowers grow. As a traveller crosses into Num-Muus, there is a shift in the light, and a golden cast falls over the terrain. At one point the road crosses a broad depression, spotted with *timkem* bushes.'

b'Nearing the edge of the famed city one may come across the idle rich, showing off on the *nutnas* field. Slightly nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller will hear the balmy song of the *min* birds, kept by the bourgeoisie. Finally the musk of *pempuk* fruit fills the air, and a traveller is surely in Paklon.'

b'In the Red District of the city, the plazas are lined with *timnon* trees. One will notice the limestone figures which decorate the rooftops. These indicate the workplace of a smith. In the event that the traveller is ill-fated enough to encounter an argument between two lovers, it may be a very instructive experience.'
