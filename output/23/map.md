## b'Qupkivnik'
b'Nearing the edge of colossal Qupkivnik one may come across mighty *slin*, prized for their horns. Somewhat nearer to the centre of the city, the traveller can faintly hear songs of sombre delight, sung by writers of Qupkivnik. Eventually the perfume of *glong* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller is surely in Qupkivnik.'

b"In the Artisans' Quarter of the city, the roadways are paved with bronze, inlaid with *glavqong* stone. The traveller will see the *nglinngepngrap* bushes. These function as a relic of the sickness which not long ago beset the surrounding countryside. If a traveller is charmed enough to stumble upon the revered Krep Qrul parade, the traveller might be drawn in, and unable to leave. In the night, one can typically hear the bells of the barbican clock. Labourers mill here, dancing."

## b'Srusnikkiv'
b'Onwards from Qupkivnik a traveller may journey north-west to Srusnikkiv. Many boats cross these waters, and the traveller can usually charter a small fishing vessel. One will enjoy braised *jlus* bird meat, flavoured with *suvngrapgeng* flowers, as eaten by sailors and passengers alike. The citric flavour is enchanting, mingling with the salty air. Though the route is remarkably safe, ships are often beset by storms. Shoals of turquoise fish can typically be spotted off the sides, bobbing and weaving in unison. The shore flocks of seabirds may occasionally be spotted, riding the wind.'

b'At the gates of the iniquitous metropolis of Srusnikkiv a traveller will make out the infamous market-hall of Jrorpimpuj. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, one will begin to hear the pleasant song of the *tannoong* birds, kept by soldiers. In the end the smell of *sitnlir* plants fills the breeze, and a traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b'Close to the bastion, the back-streets are lined with *nglinngepngrap* bushes. Philosophers cluster here, singing and telling stories. Should the traveller be so lucky as to catch sight of a herd of *slin*, bred for work by the the idle rich of Srusnikkiv, it can be an afternoon before escape is possible. The tame *jroogtan* birds will be obvious to the traveller. These betoken the home of a smith.'

## b'Srusqup Qrul'
b"Leaving Srusnikkiv one can travel to Srusqup Qrul. A traveller may hear flocks of *jlusmaqngrep* birds the land's edge, diving for fish. A traveller can usually see, in the water nearby, numerous vividly striped *qejqrulvroot* fish, darting through the water. Both fishermen and passengers eat a stew made of *vrootpak* fish and *jluspoospras* bird meat, garnished with *srusqurngrap* seed. Gales typically plague craft in this area, but the route is quite pleasant."

b'A traveller, outside the monumental city, may stumble upon scattered goldsmiths, hawking their wares. Slightly closer to the heart of the city, the traveller begins to hear songs of hopeful melancholy, sung by citizens of the Red District. Ultimately the fragrance of *glong* fruit fills the air, and one is beyond doubt in Srusqup Qrul.'

b'In the Old District, the streets are paved with granite, inlaid with marble. In the event that a traveller is unfortunate enough to come across a squabble between two lovers, it may be a most humbling experience. Writers flock here, talking. In the evening, the traveller may often hear the chimes of the university clock.'
