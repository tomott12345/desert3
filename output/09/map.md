## b'Spot P\xc3\xa2pt\xc3\xa2p'
b'The traveller, entering the city, can make out the emerald tower of the great theatre of Tyt Hom. Closer to the centre of the city, one begins to hear the delicate song of the *num* birds, kept by the idle rich. Finally the fragrance of *h\xc3\xa2t* bushes fills the breeze, and a traveller has beyond doubt arrived.'

b'Near the temple, the boulevards are lined with *h\xc3\xa2t* trees. Should the traveller be so fortunate as to see a herd of hairy *heh*, bred for racing by the writers of the city, it can be three hours before escape is possible. Actors lounge here, showing off at the game of *shn\xc3\xaamspyn*.'

## b'Spothyn'
b"Onwards from Spot P\xc3\xa2pt\xc3\xa2p one can travel north to Spothyn. Shoals of turquoise fish can typically be observed in the water nearby, leaping from wave to wave. In these waters, vessels are usually tormented by gales. Seabirds can occasionally be spotted the land's edge."

b'On entering the city of Spothyn a traveller may stumble upon crowds of hawkers, setting out their stalls. Nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the peal of the citadel clock. In the end the aroma of *mom* fruit fills the wind, and a traveller is truly in Spothyn.'

b'Close to the mint, the roadways are paved with ivory. Scholars gather here, dancing and laughing. In the event that one is ill-fated enough to catch sight of priests telling stories, a traveller may be drawn in, and find it tricky to escape. In the afternoon, the traveller can typically hear the bells of the counting-house clock.'

## b'Shm\xc3\xa2m'
b'Leaving Spothyn one can go south-west to Shm\xc3\xa2m. This route is busy, and the traveller can often obtain passage on a small fishing vessel. There are sometimes, near the side of the boat, numerous silver *fpem* fish, moving in unison. The coast, a traveller can see flocks of *num* birds.'

b'At the gates of colossal Shm\xc3\xa2m the traveller will discern the basalt dome of the monstrous palace of Shm\xc3\xaat Hom. From here, one cannot espy how farmers congregate around it. Closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller will begin to hear the song of the *sn\xc3\xa2mpap* birds, kept by petty criminals. At last the scent of *fhuk* flowers fills the air, and the traveller is undoubtedly in Shm\xc3\xa2m.'

b"In the Fishmongers' Quarter of the city, the squares are lined with *fputh\xc3\xa2t* plants. In the night, one can typically hear songs of ecstatic gloom, sung by the bourgeoisie of Shm\xc3\xa2m. Actors swarm here, trying their luck on the *nam* field."
