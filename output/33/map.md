# b'Marux to \xc5\xa0ubmarak'

## b'Daqughnab'
b'The traveller, on reaching the edge of the city of Daqughnab, can come across artisans, praying and telling stories. Somewhat nearer to the centre of the city, one will hear songs of ecstatic dejection, sung by merchants of Daqughnab. Ultimately the smell of *\xc5\xa1iykiq* flowers fills the wind, and a traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b"In the Artisans' District of the city, the plazas are paved with *abixmagh* stone, inlaid with limestone. If the traveller is so ill-fated as to encounter the revered Miba\xc5\xa1sux dance, it can be a very humbling experience. Scholars lounge here, laughing. The *kumkiq* plants will be easy to see to one. These function as a vestige of the war which long ago ravaged the surrounding countryside. A traveller can often hear the sweet song of the *gharuw* birds, kept by soldiers."

## b'Ughmaq'
b'Leaving Daqughnab one may go south-east to Ughmaq. As the traveller crosses the border into Unuxwuq, the foliage changes, giving way to pastures and woods of *naghankiq* trees. At one point the track crosses a broad valley.'

b'Passing into vast Ughmaq one can observe the copper dome of the tremendous market-hall of Isutraq. A little closer to the heart of the city, the traveller will hear the bells of the fortress clock. At last the perfume of *lirduxqaq* fruit fills the air, and a traveller is undeniably in Ughmaq.'

b'Near the bastion, the streets are lined with *kumkiq* trees. The traveller will notice the ivory gargoyles that adorn the pediments. These act to warn off evil influences. Should one be blessed enough to see a game of *musul*, it may be half a day before escape is possible. In the late evening, the traveller may typically hear songs of doleful bliss, sung by philosophers of a nearby village. Actors teem here, singing.'

## b'ar-Aqbisak'
b'From Ughmaq a traveller can travel east to ar-Aqbisak. The road is crowded, and the journey takes but two hours. When one enters Qikindaq, there is a change in the light, and a harsh cast falls over the countryside. *Kiqtu\xc5\xa1* plants grow on the roadside.'

b'A traveller, entering the city, will catch sight of labourers, trying their luck at the game of *amqanaq*. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the gentle song of the *uwisak* birds. In the end the aroma of *naghankiq* bushes fills the wind, and one has surely arrived.'

b"In the Actors' Quarter of the city, the back-streets are paved with marble, inlaid with *abixmagh* stone. In the event that a traveller is so fortunate as to stumble upon a herd of horned *ma\xc5\xa1iy*, bred for show by the priests of ar-Aqbisak, it may be a most educational experience. An inattentive visitor will not notice the tame *gharuw* birds. These are in memory of the pestilence which recently tormented the Old Quarter. In the early afternoon, the traveller can sometimes hear songs of blissful gloom, sung by the bourgeoisie of the surrounding countryside."

## b'Naba\xc5\xa1is'
b'Onwards from ar-Aqbisak one may go to Naba\xc5\xa1is. As the traveller crosses the border into ar-Axaq, the foliage changes, giving way to hedgerows and *kiqtu\xc5\xa1* flowers. Near the route, shaggy *iquybib* graze. Along the way the track crosses a deep ravine.'

b'Nearing the gates of great Naba\xc5\xa1is one will see the chryselephantine lookout of the gargantuan dancing-hall of Ughnuq. At such a large distance, the traveller is unable to discern how writers crowd near it. Closer to the centre of the city, a traveller begins to hear the peal of the castle clock. Finally the musk of *lirduxqaq* fruit fills the air, and a traveller is undoubtedly in Naba\xc5\xa1is.'

b'Around the counting-house of Qikraq, the plazas are lined with *naghankiq* plants, and the delicate fragrance fills the late morning breeze. The *\xc5\xa1iykiq* trees will be apparent. These indicate the home of an apothecary. In the night, the traveller may usually hear the clanging of the market-hall clock.'

## b'Ghartu\xc5\xa1maq'
b'Leaving Naba\xc5\xa1is one can journey north-east to Ghartu\xc5\xa1maq. A traveller can often charter a boat. The traveller may enjoy dried *uwisak* meat, spiced with *udkaq* root, as eaten by the crew. The sour taste is tasty, enriched by the salty air. By the side of the boat there are occasionally great numbers of iridescent *isxughaq* fish, darting through the water. In spite of the storms, the crossing is safe.'

b'The traveller, outside the famed city, may find merchants, hawking their wares. Somewhat nearer to the inner parts of the city, one will begin to hear songs of mournful pleasure, sung by petty criminals of the city. At last the perfume of *\xc5\xa1iykiq* plants fills the air, and the traveller is truly in Ghartu\xc5\xa1maq.'

b'In the Blue District of the city, the boulevards are paved with granite, inlaid with bronze. Should one be ill-fated enough to encounter a fight between two lovers, the traveller may be drawn in, and it can be an afternoon before escape is possible. In the morning, one can sometimes hear the balmy song of the *gharuw* birds, kept by philosophers.'

## b'Takmaq'
b"From Ghartu\xc5\xa1maq a traveller may travel north to Takmaq. As this route is busy, the traveller can sometimes obtain passage on a small vessel. Flocks of *isal* birds can typically be seen the land's edge, circling overhead. Both fishermen and passengers snack on braised seaweed, flavoured with *xakbub* seed. The flavour is clean, mingling with the salty air. In the water nearby numerous turquoise *ruq\xc5\xa1ubxugh* fish may often be spotted. The route is very pleasant, despite the gales which torment vessels."

b'At the outskirts of the tremendous metropolis of Takmaq one may espy the obsidian spire of the monumental prison of Raqaqruq. While from here it seems enchanting, the people of the city find its architecture obscene, and avoid it. Slightly closer to the heart of the city, a traveller will hear songs of mirthful dejection, sung by artisans of Takmaq. Eventually the smell of *qaqwuqbaq* fruit fills the wind, and the traveller has beyond doubt arrived.'

b'Near the temple, the roadways are lined with *kumkiq* bushes, and the golden petals rustle in the early afternoon breeze. In the evening, a traveller may usually hear the tolling of the fortress clock. The caged *uwisak* birds will be easy to see. These serve as a vestige of the revolution which in times past engulfed the Temple District. If the traveller is so charmed as to come across a herd of hairy *bibkum*, the sacred animal of \xc5\xa0ubmarak, it may be an afternoon before escape is possible. The idle rich cluster here, talking and praying.'
