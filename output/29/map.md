# b'Tschaum Ler to Duuad'

## b'Buain'
b'At the edge of monumental Buain the traveller may encounter priests, praying and talking. Slightly nearer to the inner parts of the city, one can faintly hear the knell of the citadel clock. At last the aroma of *puuid* bushes fills the wind, and a traveller has surely arrived.'

b'In the Grey District of the city, the streets are paved with lead, inlaid with sandstone. Should the traveller be so blessed as to stumble upon the famous Neuus procession, one may be drawn in, and unable to leave. Farmers cluster here, showing off on the *ketschketsraisch* court. A hasty observer will miss the tame *tschuuitspog* birds. These call to mind the pestilence which long ago engulfed Buain. A traveller may often hear songs of hopeful misery, sung by citizens of the city.'

## b'Raiigtsoep'
b'Onwards from Buain one can travel north-west to Raiigtsoep. It is a delightful journey. At one point the road crosses a deep canyon, spotted with *puuidtaikraial* flowers. As the traveller crosses the border into Tsooaisch, the vegetation changes, giving way to thickets of *boouusch* bushes and wild *gaoktimboouusch* trees. Near the side of the route, shaggy *pat* graze.'

b'A traveller, entering the metropolis of Raiigtsoep, will make out the golden roof of the immense castle of Raaiktschaik. Somewhat closer to the centre of the city, a traveller will hear the tolling of the temple clock. Ultimately the musk of *daptschebdaip* fruit fills the air, and one is without a doubt in Raiigtsoep.'

b'In the Ancient Quarter, the back-streets are lined with *puuidtaikraial* plants. The *teaikruub* stone medallions that grace the pediments will be clear to the traveller. These serve to deter evil spirits. In the event that one is lucky enough to see a quarrel between two lovers, it may be half a day before escape is possible.'

## b'Tsoepbuuain'
b'From Raiigtsoep the traveller may journey east to Tsoepbuuain. It is an agreeable journey. *Pat* graze on the track. Along the way the road crosses a broad depression. When a traveller enters Kaulbaib, there is a change in the light, and a grey cast falls across the land.'

b'The traveller, nearing the gates of the gargantuan city, may encounter *pattschom*, beloved for their meat. A little nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller will begin to hear songs of melancholy glee, sung by labourers of the Old District. Finally the scent of *boouuschteaik* trees fills the breeze, and one has truly arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the palace, the plazas are paved with basalt. In the late morning, a traveller can typically hear the song of the *tschuuitspog* birds, kept by soldiers. Philosophers flock here, dancing. One will take note of the caged *pog* birds. These mark the workplace of an artisan. If the traveller is so ill-fated as to find a game of *kets*, it can be a very humbling experience.'

## b'Tschompaiok'
b'Onwards from Tsoepbuuain a traveller can go to Tschompaiok. The route is long, but scenic, taking some days. As one crosses the border into Duuad, the greenery changes, giving way to hedgerows and meadows. By the roadside, *boouusch* plants grow.'

b'Near to mighty Tschompaiok a traveller can observe the gleaming spire of the famed bastion of Sulraaikbak. From this distance, the traveller has no way to see how the idle rich crowd by its doors, practising their skill on the *ketschketsraisch* tables. Slightly closer to the centre of the city, the traveller will begin to hear songs of joyous melancholy, sung by scholars of the surrounding countryside. Ultimately the perfume of *daptschebdaip* fruit fills the air, and one is undoubtedly in Tschompaiok.'

b'Near the watchtower of Tsur bin Bed, the back-streets are lined with *gaoktimboouusch* bushes. In the event that a traveller is unfortunate enough to come across the holy Puumkup ritual, it may be a most edifying experience. Farmers gather here, praying and telling stories.'
