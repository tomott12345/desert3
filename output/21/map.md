# b'Latulutasmil to Oluunut'

## b'Leuuuplim'
b'Nearing the outskirts of infamous Leuuuplim the traveller can catch sight of priests, trying their luck on the *uunpastitmep* field. Slightly nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller will begin to hear songs of plaintive ecstasy, sung by writers of the city. Ultimately the aroma of *tulneipuukol* trees fills the air, and one has undeniably arrived.'

b'In the Grey Quarter of the city, the squares are paved with bronze, inlaid with granite. The idle rich teem here, laughing and singing. The caged *opentum* birds will be difficult to miss to the traveller. These indicate the workplace of a fortune-teller. Should a traveller be so ill-fated as to come across an altercation between two lovers, it can be a few hours before escape is possible.'

## b'Atulnusot'
b'From Leuuuplim the traveller may travel to Atulnusot. The road is busy, and the journey takes but half a day. As one enters Atunutsumuun, there is a variation in the quality of the light, and a golden cast falls upon the landscape. At one point the track crosses a deep ravine, spotted with *nees* flowers. Near the road, shaggy *elmoptep* graze.'

b'The traveller, near to famed Atulnusot, will make out the monstrous castle of Polauapuu. Though from here it looks enchanting, the citizens of the city find its bulk distasteful, and avoid it. Somewhat closer to the heart of the city, a traveller begins to hear songs of ecstatic misery, sung by artisans of the Ancient District. At last the perfume of *upkupunemas* fruit fills the wind, and the traveller is undoubtedly in Atulnusot.'

b'Near the university, the plazas are lined with *nees* plants, and the delicate petals sway in the breeze. The bourgeoisie mill here, showing off at the game of *kitettitpukpas*. In the evening, one can occasionally hear the peal of the barbican clock.'

## b'Tultule'
b'Onwards from Atulnusot a traveller can journey south-west to Tultule. The route is well-trodden, and the journey takes but an afternoon. As the traveller crosses into pe-Tulut, the foliage changes, giving way to meadows and scrubland. By the road, *tulneipuukol* bushes grow.'

b'Near the gates of the city of Tultule one may find horned *elmoptep*, bred for racing by the labourers of the city. Slightly closer to the centre of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the song of the *enuutum* birds. Finally the musk of *upkupunemas* fruit fills the air, and the traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b'In the Red Quarter of the city, the roadways are paved with sandstone, inlaid with ivory. The *tulneipuukol* plants will be easy to see to one. These commemorate the revolution which not long ago devastated a nearby village. Should the traveller be so blessed as to come across a herd of shaggy *elmoptep*, valued for their meat, it can be a most instructive experience. Farmers lounge here, telling stories. In the morning, a traveller can usually hear the sound of the dancing-hall clock.'

## b'Uulimuu'
b'Onwards from Tultule one may travel to Uulimuu. The track is crowded, and the journey takes but three hours. Along the way the road crosses a broad rift, spotted with *tuknenemtinem* trees. *Attitpel* graze on the bank of the route.'

b'A traveller, nearing the walls of the iniquitous city, can discern the colossal bastion of Pometuuluup. Despite the fact that at such a large distance it appear quaint, the denizens of Uulimuu find its architecture repellent, and hide from it. A little nearer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the song of the *opentum* birds. Eventually the smell of *tulneipuukol* flowers fills the wind, and a traveller is truly in Uulimuu.'

b'Around the watchtower of Sunansekle, the alleyways are lined with *tuknenemtinem* trees, and the balmy fragrance fills the early afternoon air. The traveller will be humbled by the tame *opentum* birds. These serve to repel harmful spirits. In the late evening, one may often hear songs of sorrowful glee, sung by philosophers of Uulimuu. If one is unlucky enough to encounter a game of *kitettitpukpas*, it can be an afternoon before escape is possible. Soldiers crowd here, practising their skill on the *unpa* board.'
