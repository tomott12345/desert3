# b'Mrewwooknrel to Mrewprok'

## b'Wri\xca\xbbnil'
b'The traveller, approaching the edge of the vast city, will come across fruit-sellers, setting out their stalls. Nearer to the heart of the city, one will hear the sweet song of the *nlin\xca\xbbuwko\xca\xbbwroon* birds, kept by scholars. Ultimately the scent of *hloowklu\xca\xbb* fruit fills the air, and one is undeniably in Wri\xca\xbbnil.'

b'In the Grey Quarter, the squares are paved with stone, inlaid with sandstone. Actors throng here, dancing and talking. If the traveller is so charmed as to encounter an altercation between two lovers, it may be an afternoon before escape is possible.'

## b'Kokpi\xca\xbb'
b'Onwards from Wri\xca\xbbnil one can travel north to Kokpi\xca\xbb. Many craft traverse these waters, and a traveller can occasionally charter a small ship. The traveller can hear flocks of seabirds the shore, diving for *huw* fish. One will enjoy grilled *kokhuw\xca\xbbloow* fish, as eaten by crew and passengers alike. The flavour is dark.'

b'Outside infamous Kokpi\xca\xbb a traveller can see the famous university of Wuk La\xca\xbbkrup. Even though at this distance it looks elegant, natives of Kokpi\xca\xbb find its architecture distasteful, and hide from it. Closer to the centre of the city, one will begin to hear songs of gleeful misery, sung by writers of the city. At last the aroma of *winnuwwlo\xca\xbbhrup* bushes fills the breeze, and a traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'Close to the bastion, the roadways are lined with *hrupplul* flowers, and the fragrant leaves whisper in the early afternoon wind. The idle rich swarm here, practising their skill on the *nrel\xca\xbboh* court. The caged *nlin\xca\xbbuwko\xca\xbbwroon* birds will be hard to miss to the traveller. These mark the home of a smith.'

## b'Pi\xca\xbbmam'
b"From Kokpi\xca\xbb one may journey south-west to Pi\xca\xbbmam. The fishermen subsist on a stew made of turtle meat and *nuw\xca\xbbuwwrun* bird meat, spiced with *hrupwanlih* berries. The bitter taste is tasty, enriched by the salty air. The land's edge *wrewhew* birds may usually be seen, circling overhead."

b'A traveller, nearing the outskirts of the city of Pi\xca\xbbmam, may catch sight of *kowwloonhimwanwrun*, the sacred animal of Mrewprok. Somewhat nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the sound of the prison clock. Eventually the musk of *wroonwrunlihwloohhloow* fruit fills the air, and the traveller is without a doubt in Pi\xca\xbbmam.'

b"In the Tailors' District, the plazas are paved with marble, inlaid with lead. A traveller may often hear songs of dirgeful bliss, sung by citizens of the Goldsmiths' District. In the event that one is unfortunate enough to find criminals telling stories, it can be a very humbling experience. The traveller will notice the *hrupplul* plants. These function as a reminder of the war which not long ago ravaged a nearby village. The bourgeoisie teem here, laughing."
