## b'L\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1tq\xc3\xa1\xc3\xadg'
b'On reaching the gates of the tremendous city of L\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1tq\xc3\xa1\xc3\xadg the traveller may discern the granite clock-tower of the gargantuan castle of Pau\xc3\xb1-Qai\xc3\xb1ni\xc3\xb1. Despite the fact that from here it may look magnificent, citizens of L\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1tq\xc3\xa1\xc3\xadg find its bulk unsavoury, and stay away from it. Somewhat nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear songs of merry gloom, sung by artisans of L\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1tq\xc3\xa1\xc3\xadg. Ultimately the smell of *quqqai\xc3\xb1* plants fills the wind, and one has surely arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the prison, the streets are paved with lead. Soldiers flock here, dancing and telling stories. In the early morning, the traveller can occasionally hear the clanging of the counting-house clock. If a traveller is so ill-fated as to come across a game of *jusq\xc3\xa1\xc3\xadj*, it can be a very educational experience.'

## b'nin-L\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1tgut'
b'From L\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1tq\xc3\xa1\xc3\xadg one can journey to nin-L\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1tgut. The track is arduous, but rewarding, taking three weeks. When the traveller enters Qia\xc3\xb1-Gutpa\xc3\xa1v, there is a variation in the quality of the light, and a golden cast falls upon the countryside. At one point the track crosses a deep gully, spotted with *j\xc3\xadig\xc3\xb1aj* bushes. *G\xc3\xa1aqvu\xc3\xadk* graze on the bank of the road.'

b'The traveller, outside famed nin-L\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1tgut, will espy the silver dome of the vast mint of V\xc3\xadk\xc3\xb1uap. A little closer to the heart of the city, a traveller begins to hear the sweet song of the *niapj\xc3\xa1m* birds, kept by the bourgeoisie. Eventually the fragrance of *ja\xc3\xa1l* fruit fills the air, and the traveller is beyond doubt in nin-L\xc3\xad\xc3\xa1tgut.'

b'In the Temple District of the city, the alleyways are lined with *j\xc3\xadig\xc3\xb1aj* trees, and the balmy musk fills the night wind. In the event that one is so fortunate as to stumble upon an altercation between two lovers, a traveller may be drawn in, and find it hard to escape. Labourers congregate here, laughing.'
