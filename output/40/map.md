# b'Spusrusnge to Sruqvel'

## b'Sngovelmol'
b'A traveller, approaching the walls of the famed city of Sngovelmol, can find writers, singing and talking. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the gentle song of the *qevslo* birds, kept by scholars. Eventually the musk of *kol* flowers fills the breeze, and one has undeniably arrived.'

b'Near the dancing-hall, the back-streets are lined with *sngosmo* trees, and the sweet bouquet fills the late night air. The traveller can sometimes hear the peal of the theatre clock. The idle rich cluster here, showing off on the *sngospugomjum* tables. A distracted visitor will miss the ivory figurines that decorate the lintels. These serve to repel unwanted spirits. Should a traveller be blessed enough to encounter a game of *squ*, it can be a very edifying experience.'

## b'Smol-Mol'
b'Leaving Sngovelmol the traveller can journey north to Smol-Mol. At one point the route crosses a deep chasm, spotted with *kol* plants. *Sngosmo* trees grow near the edge of the road. As a traveller enters Spusngo-Sngo, the greenery changes, giving way to meadows and *sjetspu* plants.'

b'Entering the city one will catch sight of writers, telling stories. Closer to the centre of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the pleasant song of the *smu* birds. At last the smell of *sjo* fruit fills the wind, and a traveller is surely in Smol-Mol.'

b'In the Blue Quarter of the city, the streets are paved with marble, inlaid with limestone. If the traveller is so lucky as to see the revered Slotput ritual, it can be an afternoon before escape is possible. One can typically hear songs of exuberant dejection, sung by artisans of Smol-Mol. The idle rich congregate here, praying and singing.'

## b'Smulsmolko'
b'From Smol-Mol a traveller can travel north to Smulsmolko. On the side of the track, mighty *smesmengloq* graze. Along the way the route crosses a broad depression, spotted with *skensejumse* flowers. When one crosses the border into Sruqvel, there is a variation in the quality of the light, and a pale cast falls upon the land.'

b'The traveller, at the outskirts of monumental Smulsmolko, may catch sight of the sandstone towers of the tremendous bastion of Qo-Ge. Though from here it looks elegant, the denizens of the city find its architecture unsavoury, and stay away from it. Slightly nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the bells of the barbican clock. Ultimately the aroma of *mop* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'Close to the market-hall of Tosvo, the alleyways are lined with *skensejumse* bushes. In the event that one is fortunate enough to find a squabble between two lovers, a traveller might be drawn in, and unable to leave. The *kol* trees will be clear to the traveller. These function as a memento of the revolution which long ago engulfed the Red District.'
