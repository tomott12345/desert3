# b'Staap to Teh Hum'

## b'Paappaat'
b'Outside the celebrated metropolis one may observe the limestone tower of the iniquitous theatre of Munkeek. At such a great distance, the traveller has no way to catch sight of how labourers crowd around it, praying and dancing. Somewhat closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller will begin to hear songs of joyous dejection, sung by priests of a nearby village. At last the fragrance of *shakham* trees fills the breeze, and one is surely in Paappaat.'

b'In the vicinity of the market-hall of Skaahkih, the squares are paved with bronze. Farmers lounge here, telling stories. The caged *taansmak* birds will be difficult to miss to a traveller. These serve to ward off evil spirits. The traveller may usually hear the bells of the watchtower clock.'

## b'Meeh Taankap'
b'From Paappaat one can travel east to Meeh Taankap. The road is busy, and the journey takes but an afternoon. Near the fringe of the track, hairy *snunhiik* graze. As the traveller crosses the border into Humkeep, there is a shift in the quality of the light, and a bluish cast falls across the landscape. Along the way the road crosses a deep chasm, spotted with *shak* bushes.'

b'A traveller, approaching the gates of the gargantuan city of Meeh Taankap, may encounter crowds of fishmongers, setting out their stalls. A little closer to the centre of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the pleasant song of the *pemsmak* birds, kept by artisans. Eventually the aroma of *taanshon* fruit fills the breeze, and the traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b"In the Goldsmiths' District, the boulevards are paved with basalt, inlaid with limestone. One will take note of the *shakham* plants. These mark the workplace of a smith. In the event that one is fortunate enough to stumble upon the famous Stiktaan ritual, it can be half a day before escape is possible. A traveller can often hear the peal of the palace clock. The idle rich flock here, practising their skill on the *hehsham* field."

## b'nep Paap'
b'Leaving Meeh Taankap the traveller may go to nep Paap. The route is long, but scenic, taking two weeks. When the traveller enters Teh Hum, the greenery changes, giving way to open fields and meadows. At one point the road crosses a broad depression. *Shakham* flowers grow on the track.'

b'Near to nep Paap one will see the jade dome of the mighty university of Hihham. Slightly nearer to the heart of the city, a traveller begins to hear the song of the *sheeh* birds, kept by writers. Finally the bouquet of *skaahshon* fruit fills the air, and one is truly in nep Paap.'

b'Near the barbican of Hihspun, the plazas are lined with *shak* trees. The traveller may typically hear songs of mournful delight, sung by soldiers of nep Paap. Farmers mill here, singing and telling stories.'
