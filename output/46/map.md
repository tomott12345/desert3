# b'Natlisnunnap to Natkintuk'

## b'Lupsinsuk'
b'On reaching the outskirts of vast Lupsinsuk one can make out the jade towers of the monumental castle of Tunnappunlis. Although from here it seems enchanting, the natives of the city find its form repellent, and steer clear of it. Slightly nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the gentle song of the *sul* birds, kept by citizens. In the end the fragrance of *sampulminmin* trees fills the wind, and one has surely arrived.'

b"In the Old District, the alleyways are paved with lead. If a traveller is lucky enough to come across a herd of shaggy *kuklusmapnap*, bred for racing by the farmers of Lupsinsuk, it may be an afternoon before escape is possible. In the evening, one can typically hear songs of buoyant dejection, sung by merchants of the Merchants' District. Writers lounge here, talking and singing."

## b'Tanlupnupsit'
b'Onwards from Lupsinsuk the traveller may go to Tanlupnupsit. The road is crowded, and the journey takes but an afternoon. As a traveller crosses into Tummukpil, the greenery changes, giving way to *pul* flowers and meadows. On the bank of the track, *sallustan* graze.'

b'The traveller, near to the city, will find *talmalsal*, the sacred animal of Tummukpil. Closer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller will hear the knell of the market-hall clock. Eventually the scent of *sut* fruit fills the breeze, and one is beyond doubt in Tanlupnupsit.'

b'Close to the fortress of Pimpunsiksam, the streets are lined with *talpul* plants. Should the traveller be so blessed as to see the sacred Sat-Niskan procession, one may be drawn in, and unable to leave. Labourers cluster here, dancing. In the early night, the traveller may usually hear songs of hopeful gloom, sung by the bourgeoisie of a nearby village.'

## b'sat-Nus'
b'Leaving Tanlupnupsit a traveller can travel to sat-Nus. It is a smooth journey. *Sallustan* graze by the route. When the traveller enters Kantum, there is a change in the light, and a pale cast falls over the terrain.'

b'At the gates of the celebrated city of sat-Nus a traveller will espy the glistening dome of the colossal bastion of Talpuspattak. From this distance, the traveller cannot see how scholars throng near it, praying and praying. Somewhat nearer to the heart of the city, one can faintly hear the sweet song of the *sis* birds, kept by soldiers. Finally the musk of *pul* flowers fills the air, and a traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'In the Blue Quarter of the city, the roadways are paved with bronze, inlaid with limestone. The *sumnil* trees will be easy to see. These serve to deter hostile spirits. In the late morning, one can usually hear the striking of the mint clock.'

## b'Tunmus'
b'From sat-Nus the traveller may journey west to Tunmus. The road is long, but rewarding, taking some days. As one crosses the border into Maltum, the foliage changes, giving way to open fields and pastures. At one point the road crosses a deep ravine.'

b'A traveller, passing into vast Tunmus, will encounter crowds of fruit-sellers, setting out their stalls. Closer to the centre of the city, a traveller will hear songs of sorrowful exuberance, sung by priests of the surrounding countryside. At last the fragrance of *sampulminmin* bushes fills the breeze, and the traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b"Near the barbican of Nulpuskuppuk, the plazas are lined with *talpul* flowers, and the blue petals sway in the late night wind. The bourgeoisie teem here, laughing. If a traveller is unlucky enough to find criminals singing, it can be three hours before escape is possible. The traveller may often hear the balmy song of the *sul* birds, kept by labourers. An inattentive visitor will fail to see the tame *sis* birds. These commemorate the sickness which recently troubled the Artisans' Quarter."

## b'Siklup'
b"Onwards from Tunmus a traveller can go to Siklup. Many vessels traverse these waters, and the traveller can sometimes obtain passage on a fishing vessel. Both crew and passengers snack on a broth made of turtle meat and *suptulnumnap* meat, garnished with *sumnil* seed. The flavour is citric, enriched by the salty air. By the side of the boat one can usually see shoals of vermillion fish, darting through the water. The land's edge, a traveller may hear *kutsusnuktit* birds, circling overhead."

b'On entering the mighty metropolis of Siklup one may catch sight of the ivory vaulted roof of the immense watchtower of Nukpunmal. From so far, the traveller has no way to observe how soldiers gather by its bronze doors. A little closer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the sound of the market-hall clock. Ultimately the smell of *tantilsintappin* fruit fills the air, and a traveller is truly in Siklup.'

b"In the Fishmongers' District of the city, the back-streets are lined with *sampulminmin* trees. Scholars swarm here, praying and telling stories. In the event that one is so charmed as to encounter a game of *lak*, it may be a most humbling experience. The tame *suptulnumnap* birds will be clear to one. These betoken the workplace of a doctor. In the early evening, a traveller can occasionally hear songs of blissful melancholy, sung by writers of a nearby village."
