# b'Manhipepam to Kehmanminmin'

## b'Mespimopste'
b"A traveller, outside immense Mespimopste, may catch sight of hairy *stotutehske*, bred for show by the petty criminals of Mespimopste. Somewhat closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller begins to hear songs of ebullient melancholy, sung by priests of the Actors' District. Eventually the perfume of *smansnahsmukput* fruit fills the air, and one is beyond doubt in Mespimopste."

b'In the Temple Quarter of the city, the back-streets are paved with lead. The traveller will take note of the sandstone figures which decorate the lintels. These act to ward off malign spirits. A traveller can sometimes hear the song of the *smu* birds, kept by citizens. Actors crowd here, dancing.'

## b'Tusnahshu'
b'From Mespimopste one can journey north to Tusnahshu. It is an agreeable journey. As the traveller enters Snopmeman, there is a shift in the quality of the light, and a pale cast falls across the terrain. *Spotstansnahput* bushes grow near the roadside.'

b'The traveller, approaching the gates of the iniquitous metropolis, will espy the copper roof of the mighty dancing-hall of Tihsnih. Although at this distance it may look quaint, the denizens of Tusnahshu find its bulk obscene, and hide from it. A little nearer to the heart of the city, one can faintly hear the tolling of the fortress clock. In the end the bouquet of *honstespot* plants fills the wind, and a traveller has truly arrived.'

b'Near the barbican of Snihstut, the streets are lined with *spotstansnahput* trees, and the sweet fragrance fills the early afternoon breeze. The caged *smu* birds will be conspicuous. These are a reminder of the war which not long ago beset the surrounding countryside. In the early morning, the traveller may usually hear songs of forlorn glee, sung by the idle rich of the city.'

## b'Stespimop'
b'Leaving Tusnahshu a traveller may go north to Stespimop. Along the way the road crosses a broad valley, spotted with *honstespot* plants. By the route, horned *shopsto* graze. When one crosses the border into Kehmanminmin, the vegetation changes, giving way to scrubland and pastures.'

b'On entering famed Stespimop the traveller will see scattered silversmiths, hawking their wares. Slightly closer to the centre of the city, a traveller will hear the balmy song of the *nanshamste* birds. Eventually the musk of *mopstemskispik* fruit fills the air, and one is surely in Stespimop.'

b'Around the citadel, the squares are paved with marble, inlaid with stone. The bourgeoisie gather here, showing off at the game of *kutsha*. If a traveller is so unfortunate as to encounter a quarrel between two lovers, the traveller may be drawn in, and find it almost impossible to escape.'
