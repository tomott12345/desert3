# b'irz-Alnir\xc5\xa1 to Zirtda\xc5\xbe'

## b'Rildir\xc5\xa1'
b'A traveller, on entering the city, can make out the ruby spire of the tremendous temple of Armmalg. Even though from this distance it seems magnificent, the denizens of Rildir\xc5\xa1 find its bulk disagreeable, and stay away from it. Closer to the heart of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the clanging of the counting-house clock. Ultimately the perfume of *urnil* flowers fills the breeze, and one has without a doubt arrived.'

b'Around the castle, the streets are lined with *\xc5\xa1ilar\xc4\x8d* trees, and the delicate scent fills the night air. Priests lounge here, singing. If the traveller is blessed enough to come across the holy I\xc5\xa1zat ceremony, it may be a very instructive experience.'

## b'Utrild'
b'Leaving Rildir\xc5\xa1 a traveller may journey east to Utrild. Mighty *zinal\xc4\x8d* graze by the edge of the road. At one point the track crosses a broad valley, spotted with *urnil* bushes.'

b'At the edge of the city of Utrild a traveller can stumble upon a series of hawkers, setting out their stalls. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, one begins to hear songs of elegiac joy, sung by writers of the surrounding countryside. In the end the aroma of *a\xc4\x8dmalg* fruit fills the breeze, and the traveller has truly arrived.'

b"In the Artisans' District, the plazas are paved with sandstone. Soldiers crowd here, showing off on the *zu\xc5\xbeun* board. One will be humbled by the caged *rulbar* birds. These signify the home of an artisan. In the early morning, the traveller can typically hear the gentle song of the *arrulb* birds, kept by labourers. Should a traveller be fortunate enough to encounter actors laughing, one might be drawn in, and it may be half a day before escape is possible."

## b'Arrild'
b'From Utrild the traveller can travel to Arrild. As a traveller enters Alnard, the vegetation changes, giving way to open fields and hedgerows. Along the way the route crosses a deep ravine, spotted with *urnil* trees. Near the track, *a\xc5\xbear\xc4\x8d* plants grow.'

b'The traveller, near to the great metropolis, may catch sight of the chryselephantine towers of the famed palace of I\xc4\x8dmi\xc4\x8d. From so far, one is unable to observe how labourers hide from it. A little nearer to the heart of the city, a traveller can faintly hear songs of merry sadness, sung by philosophers of Arrild. Finally the bouquet of *a\xc4\x8dmalg* fruit fills the wind, and one is undeniably in Arrild.'

b'Near the prison of Urbin-I\xc4\x8dar, the back-streets are paved with limestone, inlaid with stone. In the evening, the traveller may usually hear the bells of the citadel clock. Farmers congregate here, praying and dancing.'

## b'irz-Baban'
b'Onwards from Arrild one can go to irz-Baban. It is an enjoyable journey. *Al\xc4\x8dud* graze on the roadside. As a traveller crosses the border into Zirtnalb, there is a shift in the light, and a harsh cast falls upon the terrain.'

b'Outside irz-Baban a traveller may catch sight of scholars, talking. Closer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller begins to hear the sweet song of the *rulbar* birds, kept by the idle rich. Ultimately the perfume of *\xc5\xa1ilar\xc4\x8d* trees fills the air, and a traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b"In the Merchants' Quarter, the alleyways are lined with *ar\xc4\x8darz* bushes, and the fragrant leaves shimmer in the late afternoon wind. In the event that the traveller is so ill-fated as to see the intricate Abzat dance, it can be two hours before escape is possible. The basalt figures which grace the balustrades will be conspicuous to one. These commemorate the sickness which recently beset a nearby village. Citizens teem here, trying their luck on the *utbun* tables."

## b'\xc5\xa0al\xc4\x8dbab'
b'From irz-Baban the traveller may travel to \xc5\xa0al\xc4\x8dbab. At one point the track crosses a broad rift, spotted with *ar\xc4\x8dig* flowers. Near the side of the road, *ar\xc4\x8dab* trees grow. When a traveller crosses the border into Zirtar, there is a change in the quality of the light, and a grey cast falls across the countryside.'

b'The traveller, on reaching the gates of the immense city of \xc5\xa0al\xc4\x8dbab, can find shaggy *zinal\xc4\x8d*, valued for their milk. Somewhat closer to the centre of the city, one will begin to hear songs of plaintive ecstasy, sung by writers of the city. Eventually the musk of *agi\xc5\xa1* fruit fills the breeze, and the traveller is without a doubt in \xc5\xa0al\xc4\x8dbab.'

b'In the vicinity of the watchtower, the streets are lined with *\xc5\xa1ilar\xc4\x8d* bushes, and the balmy aroma fills the early morning wind. Should one be so charmed as to come across a game of *\xc4\x8dirsab*, it can be an educational experience. A hasty visitor will overlook the *ar\xc4\x8dig* flowers. These denote the shop of an apothecary. Actors gather here, telling stories and dancing.'

## b'Urb\xc5\xa1al\xc4\x8d'
b'Leaving \xc5\xa0al\xc4\x8dbab a traveller can journey to Urb\xc5\xa1al\xc4\x8d. One can sometimes find space on a trading boat. Both sailors and passengers eat a hearty broth made of *ar\xc4\x8dab* fruit and *rulbar* bird meat, garnished with *a\xc5\xbear\xc4\x8d* seed. The clean taste is enchanting, mingling with the salty air. The coast, a traveller may see flocks of *ilrulb* birds, circling overhead. The crossing is very safe, notwithstanding the foul weather conditions which sometimes plague vessels in this area.'

b'Near the walls of monstrous Urb\xc5\xa1al\xc4\x8d the traveller will make out the sapphire clock-tower of the celebrated prison of I\xc4\x8dar-\xc5\xbdurmarm. Slightly nearer to the centre of the city, one will hear the delicate song of the *ilrulb* birds, kept by labourers. In the end the scent of *ikta\xc4\x8d* fruit fills the air, and a traveller is beyond doubt in Urb\xc5\xa1al\xc4\x8d.'

b"In the Goldsmiths' District, the squares are paved with sandstone, inlaid with *nutmalg* stone. Merchants swarm here, singing and talking. In the late evening, the traveller may often hear the chimes of the counting-house clock. If a traveller is lucky enough to catch sight of a herd of horned *\xc4\x8dukas*, bred for racing by the petty criminals of the Fishmongers' Quarter, the traveller may be drawn in, and unable to leave. The obsidian gargoyles that adorn the archways will be easy to see to one. These function as a relic of the revolution which long ago tormented a nearby village."
