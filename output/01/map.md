# b'Fnool to Moop Now'

## b'Lop Sh\xca\xbba\xca\xbb'
b'A traveller, entering Lop Sh\xca\xbba\xca\xbb, may find horned *\xca\xbbul*, the national animal of Fnool. A little closer to the heart of the city, one can faintly hear songs of doleful exuberance, sung by the bourgeoisie of Lop Sh\xca\xbba\xca\xbb. Finally the musk of *nup* plants fills the breeze, and a traveller has surely arrived.'

b'Close to the temple of Wap Him, the plazas are lined with *nup* bushes, and the blue blossoms sway in the early afternoon air. In the early night, the traveller can occasionally hear the song of the *skun* birds, kept by farmers. One will notice the *nooh* plants. These act to warn off malign spirits. Soldiers cluster here, practising their skill at the game of *\xca\xbbop*.'

## b'Sh\xca\xbba\xca\xbb Wak'
b'Leaving Lop Sh\xca\xbba\xca\xbb the traveller may go to Sh\xca\xbba\xca\xbb Wak. It is a delightful journey. Shaggy *wooh* graze by the roadside. Along the way the route crosses a deep gorge, spotted with *nup* bushes.'

b'On entering the city one can see the iniquitous bastion of Shmup Shmu\xca\xbb. Though from here it looks elegant, the citizens of the city find its form obscene, and steer clear of it. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the tolling of the dancing-hall clock. At last the perfume of *nooh* plants fills the wind, and a traveller is undoubtedly in Sh\xca\xbba\xca\xbb Wak.'

b'In the Temple District of the city, the back-streets are paved with limestone. Philosophers congregate here, dancing and laughing. The tame *poon* birds will be clear to a traveller. These call to mind the war which not long ago ravaged the city. One may sometimes hear songs of ecstatic melancholy, sung by scholars of the surrounding countryside. In the event that the traveller is blessed enough to see an argument between two lovers, it may be half a day before escape is possible.'

## b'Niw won Now'
b'From Sh\xca\xbba\xca\xbb Wak a traveller can travel west to Niw won Now. The track is crowded, and the journey takes but an afternoon. As one enters Koom won Now, the greenery changes, giving way to wild *nup* flowers and pastures. At one point the route crosses a deep gully.'

b'A traveller, approaching the edge of the great metropolis of Niw won Now, will encounter scattered merchants, hawking their wares. A little nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller begins to hear the song of the *skun* birds, kept by writers. In the end the musk of *\xca\xbben* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller has undeniably arrived.'

b'In the Red Quarter of the city, the alleyways are lined with *nooh* bushes. A careless traveller will not notice the *nooh* flowers. These act as a caution to harmful influences. Criminals flock here, trying their luck on the *shwen* court.'

## b'Niw Lop'
b'Onwards from Niw won Now one may go north-east to Niw Lop. By the track, *nup* trees grow. Along the way the road crosses a broad depression, spotted with *nup* plants. When the traveller enters Shpa\xca\xbb, there is a variation in the quality of the light, and a golden cast falls upon the land.'

b'Passing into the city of Niw Lop a traveller will espy the crystal roof of the monumental university of Pin won Wop. Despite the fact that from so far it may appear magnificent, the people of the city find its architecture repellent, and avoid it. Slightly closer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller will hear the sound of the barbican clock. Eventually the smell of *\xca\xbben* fruit fills the wind, and one is surely in Niw Lop.'

b'Around the castle, the streets are paved with lead, inlaid with stone. A distracted observer will miss the *fkoom* stone medallions which ornament the lintels. These indicate the place of business of a fortune-teller. If the traveller is so unlucky as to come across a game of *hen*, it can be a very humbling experience.'

## b'Moop Niw'
b'Leaving Niw Lop a traveller can journey north-west to Moop Niw. At one point the route crosses a broad rift. Mighty *\xca\xbbul* graze on the roadside. When one crosses the border into Moop Now, the foliage changes, giving way to hedgerows and meadows.'

b'The traveller, on reaching the gates of colossal Moop Niw, will catch sight of artisans, telling stories. Nearer to the centre of the city, the traveller begins to hear songs of melancholy glee, sung by petty criminals of the Blue District. Ultimately the scent of *nooh* flowers fills the air, and one has beyond doubt arrived.'

b'In the Temple Quarter of the city, the roadways are lined with *nup* bushes. If the traveller is so lucky as to see writers talking, it may be a most edifying experience. In the late evening, a traveller can typically hear the song of the *skun* birds. Soldiers swarm here, showing off at the game of *hen*.'
