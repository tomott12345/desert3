# b'Kerbtal to Kobiid'

## b'Kiisur'
b'A traveller, at the walls of the metropolis, can catch sight of fishmongers, setting out their stalls. Somewhat nearer to the centre of the city, the traveller will hear songs of sombre ecstasy, sung by merchants of the Grey Quarter. Ultimately the scent of *eerjled* flowers fills the breeze, and a traveller has undeniably arrived.'

b'Around the temple of Kurlars, the boulevards are paved with basalt, inlaid with obsidian. In the early evening, one may sometimes hear the tolling of the theatre clock. The traveller will see the tame *surkutch* birds. These commemorate the plague which not long ago troubled a nearby village. If a traveller is unlucky enough to find a herd of mighty *keermziim*, bred for racing by the artisans of the surrounding countryside, it can be half a day before escape is possible. The idle rich cluster here, singing.'

## b'ob-Beleerd'
b'Leaving Kiisur the traveller may go north-west to ob-Beleerd. It is a simple journey. Near the roadside, *etled* bushes grow. As one enters Surtchkerb, the greenery changes, giving way to open fields and scrubland. Along the way the route crosses a deep chasm, spotted with *eerjled* plants.'

b'Entering ob-Beleerd a traveller can make out the monstrous bastion of Ob-Eerdlars. From this distance, one has no way to espy how writers avoid it, practising their skill at the game of *ubeerj*. Slightly closer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the song of the *jarutch* birds, kept by actors. In the end the aroma of *iirtam* fruit fills the air, and a traveller is undoubtedly in ob-Beleerd.'

b"In the Goldsmiths' District of the city, the back-streets are lined with *etled* bushes. The sandstone figurines which decorate the eaves will be obvious to one. These betoken the shop of a fortune-teller. Labourers teem here, showing off on the *ubeerj* field."

## b'Saarmotch'
b'From ob-Beleerd a traveller may travel north-west to Saarmotch. The track is busy, and the journey takes but a few hours. At one point the road crosses a broad rift, spotted with *bibled* trees. *Tchirmled* plants grow by the track. When one crosses into Otchiid, there is a shift in the quality of the light, and a pale cast falls across the landscape.'

b'The traveller, approaching the outskirts of the great city of Saarmotch, may encounter *keermziim*, valued for their leather. A little nearer to the centre of the city, the traveller will begin to hear songs of forlorn joy, sung by the bourgeoisie of the city. Finally the scent of *iirtop* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller has truly arrived.'

b'Close to the prison, the alleyways are paved with lead, inlaid with stone. The *ledak* flowers will be clear to a traveller. These serve as a warning to malign spirits. Should the traveller be so unfortunate as to stumble upon criminals talking, it may be an instructive experience.'

## b'ob-Eerdsaarm'
b'Onwards from Saarmotch one can journey to ob-Eerdsaarm. It is a smooth journey. Near the edge of the road, hairy *kiisnaam* graze. Along the way the route crosses a deep gully.'

b'On entering the colossal city a traveller may catch sight of the limestone vaulted roof of the monumental barbican of Larssad. Even though from so far it appear elegant, the natives of ob-Eerdsaarm find its architecture repellent, and steer clear of it. Closer to the heart of the city, the traveller begins to hear the knell of the temple clock. Finally the bouquet of *tchirmled* trees fills the wind, and a traveller is surely in ob-Eerdsaarm.'

b'In the Ancient Quarter of the city, the roadways are lined with *bibled* bushes, and the delicate petals shimmer in the late morning breeze. A careless traveller will overlook the caged *jarutch* birds. These betoken the workplace of a smith. In the event that one is charmed enough to find a game of *ubam*, the traveller might be drawn in, and find it tricky to escape.'
