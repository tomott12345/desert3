# b'Asim Imad to I\xc4\x8dijus Ijag'

## b'am Azanum'
b'Outside the metropolis of am Azanum the traveller may espy the infamous mint of I\xc5\xbeudapit. Slightly closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller will begin to hear the balmy song of the *u\xc4\x8din* birds. In the end the fragrance of *unadin* fruit fills the wind, and one has truly arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the university of Ugumum, the alleyways are lined with *a\xc4\x8dan* plants, and the red petals shimmer in the evening air. A careless visitor will overlook the caged *inis* birds. These call to mind the pestilence which recently tormented the surrounding countryside. In the afternoon, the traveller may typically hear songs of merry gloom, sung by citizens of a nearby village. Priests gather here, showing off at *u\xc5\xbeajuki\xc4\x8d*.'

## b'Anu\xc4\x8d Azanum'
b'Leaving am Azanum a traveller may journey north-west to Anu\xc4\x8d Azanum. It is a simple journey. On the roadside, shaggy *ubi\xc5\xbead* graze. As a traveller crosses the border into Inimi\xc4\x8dip, the greenery changes, giving way to hedgerows and meadows.'

b'A traveller, at the gates of the famed city, can catch sight of scholars, talking. A little nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller begins to hear songs of mournful exuberance, sung by farmers of the city. At last the smell of *ahiz* flowers fills the breeze, and one is undoubtedly in Anu\xc4\x8d Azanum.'

b"In the Goldsmiths' District of the city, the boulevards are paved with granite, inlaid with obsidian. Petty criminals swarm here, dancing. Should a traveller be ill-fated enough to find a game of *isu\xc5\xbeid*, one might be drawn in, and find it tricky to escape. In the late morning, the traveller can sometimes hear the song of the *inazadaz* birds, kept by labourers."

## b'am Apawusan'
b'From Anu\xc4\x8d Azanum the traveller may travel north-east to am Apawusan. The track is busy, and the journey takes but a couple of hours. As a traveller enters Idazim, there is a change in the quality of the light, and a bluish cast falls across the landscape. *Adugudup* bushes grow by the road.'

b'Near to immense am Apawusan one will catch sight of the great counting-house of Am Uga\xc4\x8dut. Despite the fact that from here it seems enchanting, the citizens of the city find its form obscene, and avoid it. Somewhat closer to the centre of the city, the traveller will hear the knell of the market-hall clock. Finally the bouquet of *isasinih* fruit fills the wind, and one has beyond doubt arrived.'

b'Close to the castle of Igukidip, the squares are lined with *ahiz* bushes, and the emerald blossoms sway in the early night breeze. The bourgeoisie crowd here, practising their skill on the *isu\xc5\xbeid* tables. The basalt statues which ornament the pediments will be easy to see. These act as a memento of the revolution which twenty years ago ravaged the surrounding countryside. In the afternoon, a traveller may occasionally hear songs of doleful pleasure, sung by citizens of am Apawusan. In the event that the traveller is so blessed as to come across a herd of mighty *i\xc5\xbein*, prized for their horns, it may be an afternoon before escape is possible.'

## b'Izanusa\xc5\xbe'
b'Onwards from am Apawusan one can journey to Izanusa\xc5\xbe. The route is long, but rewarding, taking several weeks. Hairy *iki\xc5\xbe* graze on the roadside. Along the way the track crosses a deep chasm, spotted with *a\xc4\x8dan* trees. When the traveller crosses the border into I\xc4\x8dijus Ijag, the foliage changes, giving way to wild *ahiz* flowers and scrubland.'

b'The traveller, approaching the walls of the metropolis of Izanusa\xc5\xbe, may encounter horned *amun*, bred for show by the labourers of the city. A little nearer to the heart of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the sound of the dancing-hall clock. Ultimately the aroma of *adugudup* flowers fills the air, and the traveller is undoubtedly in Izanusa\xc5\xbe.'

b'In the Temple Quarter of the city, the plazas are paved with *iwikuj* stone. In the evening, a traveller can often hear the pleasant song of the *inada\xc5\xbeig* birds, kept by priests. Should one be unfortunate enough to stumble upon the holy Ubumabug parade, the traveller might be drawn in, and unable to leave. Merchants congregate here, laughing and talking. One will see the tame *inis* birds. These serve to repel malign spirits.'
