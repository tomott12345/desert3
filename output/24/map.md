# b'n\xc3\xa9 Selup\xc3\xadpi to n\xc3\xa9 Lupe'

## b'n\xc3\xa9 Tak\xc3\xa1s\xc3\xa9tu'
b'Near the outskirts of the city one may observe the sandstone roof of the mighty dancing-hall of Mikaliko. Despite the fact that from so far it may look elegant, citizens of the city find its bulk unsavoury, and stay away from it. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller begins to hear the delicate song of the *nelu* birds. Finally the scent of *n\xc3\xa1k\xc3\xa9lut\xc3\xa1* plants fills the wind, and one has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the counting-house, the squares are lined with *k\xc3\xa9su* flowers, and the fragrant blossoms shimmer in the breeze. Farmers crowd here, practising their skill at *mut\xc3\xa1*. If the traveller is ill-fated enough to encounter the idle rich laughing, it can be a very edifying experience. A distracted traveller will miss the basalt statues which decorate the pediments. These act to warn off hostile influences. A traveller can occasionally hear songs of elegiac joy, sung by priests of the city.'

## b'n\xc3\xa9 M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9'
b'From n\xc3\xa9 Tak\xc3\xa1s\xc3\xa9tu the traveller may go south-west to n\xc3\xa9 M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9. It is a pleasant journey. When one enters Lepes\xc3\xa1nu, there is a change in the light, and a grey cast falls across the land. On the roadside, *k\xc3\xa9ki* trees grow. At one point the track crosses a deep chasm.'

b'The traveller, on entering n\xc3\xa9 M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9, can see hairy *tosanok\xc3\xa1*, the national animal of Lepes\xc3\xa1nu. Closer to the centre of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the knell of the watchtower clock. In the end the perfume of *non\xc3\xadku* fruit fills the wind, and one is surely in n\xc3\xa9 M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9.'

b'In the Temple Quarter of the city, the back-streets are paved with limestone. Labourers swarm here, dancing and telling stories. Should a traveller be so unlucky as to find a herd of shaggy *kopupusa*, beloved for their milk, it may be a few hours before escape is possible. In the late afternoon, the traveller may sometimes hear songs of blissful gloom, sung by scholars of a nearby village.'

## b'L\xc3\xa9metu'
b'Onwards from n\xc3\xa9 M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9 a traveller can journey north to L\xc3\xa9metu. The route is arduous, but rewarding, taking many weeks. Horned *pesa* graze by the roadside. Along the way the track crosses a broad valley. When one crosses the border into Lupeluku, the greenery changes, giving way to open fields and hedgerows.'

b'Approaching the edge of the metropolis of L\xc3\xa9metu a traveller can see the obsidian dome of the celebrated temple of Tomes\xc3\xa1no. From this distance, the traveller has no way to make out how actors avoid it, singing. A little nearer to the heart of the city, one will begin to hear the striking of the bastion clock. Ultimately the musk of *n\xc3\xa1k\xc3\xa9lut\xc3\xa1* plants fills the breeze, and a traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b'Around the barbican of Tutos\xc3\xa9lo, the plazas are lined with *l\xc3\xa1k\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa1* flowers. The *k\xc3\xa1ko* trees will be easy to see to one. These are in memory of the plague which long ago ravaged L\xc3\xa9metu. Should a traveller be so blessed as to catch sight of a fight between two lovers, the traveller may be drawn in, and find it hard to escape. Priests throng here, trying their luck on the *mut\xc3\xa1* tables. One can typically hear songs of melancholy ecstasy, sung by merchants of the Green District.'

## b'M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9 Lanako'
b'Leaving L\xc3\xa9metu one may travel north-east to M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9 Lanako. It is a smooth journey. Shaggy *kopupusa* graze near the route. As the traveller crosses into Papel\xc3\xa1, there is a variation in the light, and a bluish cast falls over the countryside. At one point the track crosses a deep ravine.'

b'A traveller, passing into the city, may catch sight of the golden vaulted roof of the infamous prison of N\xc3\xa9 Kanu. Even though at such a great distance it may appear beautiful, natives of M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9 Lanako find its architecture obscene, and shun it. Slightly closer to the centre of the city, a traveller will begin to hear the sound of the castle clock. Eventually the perfume of *non\xc3\xadku* fruit fills the air, and one is undeniably in M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9 Lanako.'

b"In the Goldsmiths' Quarter, the roadways are lined with *k\xc3\xa9su* plants. If the traveller is charmed enough to come across a game of *mut\xc3\xa1*, it can be a most humbling experience. A distracted observer will overlook the caged *tuk\xc3\xa1nes\xc3\xa1* birds. These mark the workplace of a doctor. In the early night, a traveller can usually hear songs of mirthful misery, sung by farmers of the surrounding countryside. Petty criminals congregate here, dancing and laughing."

## b'M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9 P\xc3\xa9mapo'
b'From M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9 Lanako one can journey to M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9 P\xc3\xa9mapo. Along the way the road crosses a broad depression, spotted with *l\xc3\xa1k\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa1* flowers. When a traveller enters Lupe Tinose, the foliage changes, giving way to pastures and groves of *k\xc3\xa9su* bushes.'

b'Nearing the gates of M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9 P\xc3\xa9mapo the traveller may encounter farmers, telling stories. A little nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller will hear the pleasant song of the *nelu* birds. At last the smell of *k\xc3\xa9ki* plants fills the wind, and a traveller has truly arrived.'

b'Near the market-hall, the alleyways are paved with sandstone, inlaid with stone. In the late morning, one may sometimes hear songs of heavy-hearted exuberance, sung by philosophers of a nearby village. The tame *tuk\xc3\xa1nes\xc3\xa1* birds will be clear. These act as a warning to evil spirits. In the event that the traveller is so unlucky as to stumble upon the idle rich talking, one might be drawn in, and unable to leave. Labourers mill here, singing and laughing.'

## b'K\xc3\xa1tila'
b'Onwards from M\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa9 P\xc3\xa9mapo the traveller may go north-east to K\xc3\xa1tila. Near the verge of the route, *k\xc3\xa9su* trees grow. At one point the road crosses a deep gorge, spotted with *t\xc3\xa9s\xc3\xadne* bushes. As a traveller crosses the border into n\xc3\xa9 Lupe, there is a shift in the quality of the light, and a grey cast falls upon the terrain.'

b'The traveller, outside the monstrous city of K\xc3\xa1tila, will discern the immense watchtower of Suto t\xc3\xa9 Poka. Somewhat closer to the centre of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the song of the *tol\xc3\xa9* birds. Finally the aroma of *non\xc3\xadku* fruit fills the air, and a traveller is undeniably in K\xc3\xa1tila.'

b"In the Fishmongers' Quarter of the city, the back-streets are lined with *k\xc3\xa9su* flowers, and the balmy bouquet fills the afternoon breeze. Citizens cluster here, showing off at *tul\xc3\xa1*. In the early morning, one can usually hear the knell of the counting-house clock. If the traveller is ill-fated enough to catch sight of a herd of mighty *pesa*, bred for show by the priests of the surrounding countryside, a traveller may be drawn in, and it can be half a day before escape is possible."
