# b'Kumkun to Kunnanalk'

## b'Kumnat Lipil'
b'A traveller, outside the famed city, will find mighty *paknappulk*, the sacred animal of Kumkun. A little nearer to the centre of the city, a traveller will hear the balmy song of the *tankaktantuk* birds. Ultimately the musk of *lilsaltpusuk* trees fills the breeze, and the traveller has surely arrived.'

b'Around the fortress of Pulnlul, the boulevards are paved with basalt, inlaid with stone. The idle rich cluster here, talking and praying. The tame *tukpuli* birds will be easy to see to one. These act as a deterrent to unwanted influences. If a traveller is lucky enough to stumble upon the famous Mapulkult procession, it can be a most educational experience. In the late morning, the traveller may often hear the clanging of the temple clock.'

## b'Katkalsulknu'
b'From Kumnat Lipil one may travel west to Katkalsulknu. It is a smooth journey. Along the way the road crosses a deep gorge, spotted with *lilsaltpusuk* bushes. Hairy *pakpilpkuknulmulp* graze near the route.'

b'Nearing the walls of the metropolis of Katkalsulknu a traveller can make out the obsidian roof of the celebrated watchtower of Kissiltan. From this distance, the traveller is unable to catch sight of how farmers avoid it. Somewhat closer to the heart of the city, a traveller will begin to hear the pleasant song of the *tankaktantuk* birds, kept by artisans. Finally the aroma of *kuptu* fruit fills the wind, and the traveller has truly arrived.'

b"In the Artisans' District of the city, the back-streets are lined with *mulppulksaltsalti* plants, and the sweet scent fills the late evening air. Should one be so unlucky as to see an argument between two lovers, it may be a very edifying experience. The granite figures which adorn the lintels will be apparent to one. These denote the workplace of a fortune-teller. Labourers lounge here, singing. In the early afternoon, a traveller can usually hear songs of elegiac glee, sung by philosophers of the surrounding countryside."

## b'Nukumnukat'
b'Leaving Katkalsulknu the traveller can journey west to Nukumnukat. It is a pleasant journey. At one point the track crosses a broad rift. On the bank of the road, *pakpilpkuknulmulp* graze. As one crosses the border into Talkilsman, there is a change in the quality of the light, and a harsh cast falls over the land.'

b'The traveller, approaching the gates of Nukumnukat, may come across the idle rich, showing off at *lalmiltan*. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the sound of the palace clock. At last the fragrance of *lilssalt* trees fills the breeze, and the traveller is without a doubt in Nukumnukat.'

b'In the vicinity of the prison of Pumalslul, the alleyways are paved with obsidian. In the late night, a traveller may sometimes hear the peal of the university clock. If a traveller is so fortunate as to encounter a herd of *pakpilpkuknulmulp*, valued for their horns, it may be an afternoon before escape is possible. A distracted traveller will fail to see the caged *siltuklulna* birds. These commemorate the sickness which recently engulfed the Green Quarter. Priests flock here, talking and telling stories.'

## b'Siskutmuk'
b'Onwards from Nukumnukat one may travel north to Siskutmuk. The route is crowded, and the journey takes but half a day. *Mulppulksaltsalti* bushes grow by the roadside. When the traveller enters Lislunpul, the vegetation changes, giving way to scrubland and copses of *lilssalt* plants. Along the way the road crosses a deep ravine, spotted with *lilsaltpusuk* flowers.'

b'Near to the famous city of Siskutmuk the traveller may see the vast barbican of Kul Tilmiln. While from so far it seems magnificent, denizens of the city find its form repellent, and shun it. A little closer to the heart of the city, a traveller begins to hear songs of joyous melancholy, sung by citizens of Siskutmuk. Eventually the bouquet of *kuptu* fruit fills the wind, and one is truly in Siskutmuk.'

b'In the Temple District of the city, the squares are lined with *saltkak* trees. The traveller can often hear the gentle song of the *tukpuli* birds. In the event that a traveller is ill-fated enough to catch sight of a game of *lalmiltan*, the traveller might be drawn in, and find it difficult to escape. The bourgeoisie teem here, laughing.'

## b'Kumkitmusulk'
b'From Siskutmuk one may go north to Kumkitmusulk. The route is well-trodden, and the journey takes but two hours. As a traveller crosses the border into Mulpnalis, there is a shift in the quality of the light, and a bluish cast falls across the terrain. At one point the track crosses a broad valley, spotted with *mulppulksaltsalti* plants. On the edge of the route, *saltlulklilnulsu* bushes grow.'

b'A traveller, on entering monumental Kumkitmusulk, can make out the granite vaulted roof of the tremendous theatre of Pulnkulk. From here, the traveller has no way to observe how writers congregate by its walls, dancing and singing. Somewhat nearer to the centre of the city, one will hear songs of melancholy exuberance, sung by artisans of a nearby village. Finally the smell of *saltkak* flowers fills the breeze, and a traveller has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'Close to the prison, the boulevards are paved with marble, inlaid with sandstone. In the early evening, one can typically hear the tolling of the watchtower clock. The *lassaltsulplun* trees will be conspicuous to the traveller. These signify the place of business of an artisan. If a traveller is so unfortunate as to stumble upon a squabble between two lovers, it may be a most instructive experience. Criminals throng here, talking.'

## b'Nukat'
b'Onwards from Kumkitmusulk one can journey north to Nukat. It is a simple journey. Shaggy *tumnumitult* graze by the road. Along the way the track crosses a deep gully, spotted with *saltlulklilnulsu* bushes. When a traveller enters Kunnanalk, the foliage changes, giving way to wild *kilkumsalt* flowers and hedgerows.'

b'On reaching the outskirts of the infamous metropolis the traveller will see mighty *milunlinlilskalm*, prized for their milk. Closer to the heart of the city, one will begin to hear the delicate song of the *siltuklulna* birds. In the end the musk of *pilplasmakkup* fruit fills the air, and the traveller is beyond doubt in Nukat.'

b'In the Blue Quarter, the roadways are lined with *lilsmaktat* plants. Scholars crowd here, practising their skill on the *sasalnupul* court. One will be inspired by the *lilssalt* trees. These deter evil spirits. In the morning, a traveller may usually hear songs of buoyant gloom, sung by labourers of Nukat. Should the traveller be unlucky enough to encounter the holy Kul Tumlu ritual, it can be an afternoon before escape is possible.'
