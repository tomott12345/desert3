# b'Jlivsar to Rurkloq'

## b'Jlem Qlak'
b'The traveller, at the gates of the vast metropolis of Jlem Qlak, can observe the golden roof of the famous palace of Slasrav. Closer to the inner parts of the city, one will begin to hear the clanging of the dancing-hall clock. Finally the smell of *jlavvloj* trees fills the breeze, and a traveller is undoubtedly in Jlem Qlak.'

b'Around the bastion, the squares are lined with *rumjlav* flowers, and the delicate blossoms rustle in the afternoon air. Artisans mill here, singing and telling stories. In the late morning, the traveller can typically hear the delicate song of the *rev* birds, kept by the idle rich.'

## b'Rumklan Jag'
b'From Jlem Qlak one may journey west to Rumklan Jag. The road is long, but scenic, taking several days. *Rumjlav* bushes grow near the roadside. Along the way the route crosses a deep ravine, spotted with *jlavvloj* plants. As a traveller enters Sarraq, the foliage changes, giving way to open fields and hedgerows.'

b'Passing into tremendous Rumklan Jag one can encounter pedlars, hawking their wares. Slightly nearer to the centre of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the song of the *vlir* birds. At last the aroma of *vlung* fruit fills the wind, and one has surely arrived.'

b'In the Old Quarter of the city, the alleyways are lined with *plangjlir* flowers. Labourers throng here, praying. The basalt gargoyles which ornament the rooftops will be easy to see to the traveller. These serve as a warning to harmful spirits. Should one be unlucky enough to come across writers laughing, it may be a couple of hours before escape is possible.'

## b'Nlap Klar'
b'Onwards from Rumklan Jag the traveller may go south-west to Nlap Klar. It is a pleasant journey. At one point the road crosses a broad valley, spotted with *rumjlav* bushes. On the side of the track, *slur* plants grow.'

b'A traveller, on reaching the walls of the city, will espy the mighty barbican of Mlolrer. Somewhat nearer to the heart of the city, a traveller will hear the striking of the theatre clock. Eventually the musk of *plangjlir* flowers fills the breeze, and one has truly arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the mint of Mlol Nlor, the boulevards are paved with obsidian, inlaid with granite. Petty criminals lounge here, showing off at the game of *gom*. If a traveller is so unfortunate as to see the sacred Qatklog dance, it may be a most educational experience. A hasty traveller will overlook the *sal* trees. These indicate the workplace of a doctor. In the early evening, the traveller may occasionally hear songs of elegiac delight, sung by priests of the surrounding countryside.'
