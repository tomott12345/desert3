## b'\xc5\xa0lokt\xc3\xb6mkun'
b'The traveller, near to the vast metropolis, can come across citizens, practising their skill on the *\xc5\xa1loksopstot* court. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, one will hear the striking of the fortress clock. Ultimately the perfume of *spom\xc5\xa1neps\xc3\xa4kmusnit* plants fills the air, and a traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b'Around the counting-house of Nukkonsonnip, the plazas are paved with bronze. A distracted visitor will not notice the *sl\xc3\xa4mpels\xc3\xb6knonsnat* bushes. These call to mind the war which twenty years ago troubled the surrounding countryside. Artisans congregate here, dancing. In the afternoon, a traveller can often hear the song of the *tiln\xc3\xb6tsnat* birds, kept by merchants.'

## b'Snast\xc3\xb6m'
b'Onwards from \xc5\xa0lokt\xc3\xb6mkun one may go to Snast\xc3\xb6m. It is a delightful journey. When the traveller enters \xc5\xa0tok\xc5\xa1m\xc3\xb6t, the vegetation changes, giving way to open fields and clumps of *spom\xc5\xa1neps\xc3\xa4kmusnit* trees. Along the way the route crosses a deep gorge, spotted with *snokpas\xc5\xa1neplopsnok* flowers. *Sl\xc3\xa4mpels\xc3\xb6knonsnat* bushes grow on the roadside.'

b'At the walls of the monumental city a traveller will encounter horned *snes\xc5\xa1tus\xc5\xa1momseslep*, the sacred animal of \xc5\xa0tok\xc5\xa1m\xc3\xb6t. Slightly closer to the heart of the city, one will begin to hear songs of mournful pleasure, sung by farmers of Snast\xc3\xb6m. At last the smell of *nitsnat\xc5\xa1t\xc3\xbcn\xc5\xa1mum* trees fills the breeze, and a traveller is truly in Snast\xc3\xb6m.'

b'Near the prison of Lempopsonnon, the boulevards are lined with *nitsnat\xc5\xa1t\xc3\xbcn\xc5\xa1mum* plants. The caged *pusst\xc3\xbcllunspop* birds will be almost impossible to miss to one. These function as a caution to hostile spirits. Scholars flock here, talking and telling stories. The traveller can occasionally hear the tolling of the theatre clock. If one is fortunate enough to stumble upon actors dancing, a traveller might be drawn in, and unable to leave.'

## b'Maslop'
b'From Snast\xc3\xb6m a traveller can travel west to Maslop. The road is long, but scenic, taking several days. As the traveller crosses the border into \xc5\xa0toknon, there is a change in the light, and a grey cast falls over the landscape. On the track, shaggy *snes\xc5\xa1tus\xc5\xa1momseslep* graze. Along the way the track crosses a broad rift, spotted with *snokpas\xc5\xa1neplopsnok* trees.'

b'A traveller, passing into the metropolis of Maslop, will espy the famed bastion of \xc5\xa0not\xc5\xa1t\xc3\xbcn. From this distance, one cannot see how citizens shun it, showing off at the game of *\xc5\xa1t\xc3\xbcnlunsop*. Closer to the centre of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the song of the *pusst\xc3\xbcllunspop* birds. In the end the aroma of *nak\xc5\xa1pam\xc5\xa1t\xc3\xbcn* fruit fills the wind, and one has undeniably arrived.'

b"In the Goldsmiths' District of the city, the squares are paved with granite, inlaid with limestone. Priests throng here, singing. A hasty visitor will miss the marble figurines which grace the doorways. These mark the home of an artisan. In the evening, a traveller may usually hear songs of mirthful sadness, sung by merchants of the city."

## b'Popt\xc3\xb6m\xc5\xa1tus'
b'Leaving Maslop a traveller can go to Popt\xc3\xb6m\xc5\xa1tus. When the traveller enters Nomsl\xc3\xa4m, the greenery changes, giving way to meadows and *mossnum* plants. By the bank of the road, *spom\xc5\xa1neps\xc3\xa4kmusnit* flowers grow. At one point the route crosses a broad valley, spotted with *\xc5\xa1mumnustom\xc5\xa1mom* bushes.'

b'Outside colossal Popt\xc3\xb6m\xc5\xa1tus the traveller may find scattered silversmiths, hawking their wares. A little nearer to the inner parts of the city, one will hear the knell of the watchtower clock. Eventually the bouquet of *m\xc3\xa4ssotlop\xc5\xa1t\xc3\xbcn* fruit fills the air, and a traveller is beyond doubt in Popt\xc3\xb6m\xc5\xa1tus.'

b'In the New Quarter of the city, the plazas are paved with sandstone, inlaid with obsidian. One may sometimes hear the pleasant song of the *konst\xc3\xbclkun* birds, kept by the bourgeoisie. In the event that the traveller is so charmed as to see a herd of *panses*, beloved for their meat, it can be a humbling experience. The *\xc5\xa1mumnustom\xc5\xa1mom* plants will be conspicuous to a traveller. These warn off harmful influences.'

## b'Nassnos'
b'Onwards from Popt\xc3\xb6m\xc5\xa1tus the traveller may journey north-west to Nassnos. It is an agreeable journey. As one crosses the border into Sn\xc3\xb6l\xc5\xa1p\xc3\xa4pkal, there is a shift in the light, and a bluish cast falls upon the terrain. Mighty *nipses* graze near the roadside. At one point the road crosses a deep chasm.'

b'A traveller, approaching the gates of the city, may observe the sandstone spire of the tremendous mint of Mut\xc5\xa1kin\xc5\xa1k\xc3\xbcl. From here, a traveller has no way to discern how citizens swarm near its chryselephantine gate, dancing and praying. Somewhat nearer to the heart of the city, one will begin to hear the chimes of the market-hall clock. Finally the fragrance of *kalmun\xc5\xa1nep* trees fills the breeze, and a traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the watchtower of \xc5\xa0lok\xc5\xa1not, the roadways are lined with *nitsnat\xc5\xa1t\xc3\xbcn\xc5\xa1mum* bushes, and the gentle musk fills the early morning wind. In the late afternoon, the traveller can occasionally hear the delicate song of the *konst\xc3\xbclkun* birds, kept by artisans. The traveller will take note of the stone gargoyles that ornament the archways. These denote the workplace of an apothecary. Priests teem here, telling stories.'
