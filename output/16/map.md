# b'ul-Nup-o-Ke to S\xc3\xa1-o-L\xc3\xa9t'

## b'Es-o-Am'
b'The traveller, at the edge of the famous city, will make out the obsidian vaulted roof of the famed temple of Ma-o-Tit. From so far, one cannot espy how actors steer clear of it, telling stories and laughing. Slightly closer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller begins to hear the chimes of the citadel clock. Finally the perfume of *sol* fruit fills the breeze, and one has without a doubt arrived.'

b'Around the barbican of Ul-Ma, the streets are paved with bronze, inlaid with obsidian. If the traveller is ill-fated enough to find a herd of shaggy *ut*, the national animal of ul-Nup-o-Ke, one may be drawn in, and it may be a few hours before escape is possible. In the early evening, a traveller can occasionally hear the song of the *mus* birds, kept by scholars.'

## b'N\xc3\xa1s-Es'
b'Leaving Es-o-Am the traveller can travel north-east to N\xc3\xa1s-Es. A traveller can sometimes find space on a boat. In spite of the squalls, the route is remarkably safe. Both fishermen and passengers subsist on a thin soup made of *at* fish and turtle meat, garnished with *tum* root. The flavour is citric, mingling with the salty air.'

b'A traveller, passing into the monstrous city of N\xc3\xa1s-Es, may stumble upon *ut*, bred for racing by the artisans of the city. Somewhat nearer to the centre of the city, the traveller will begin to hear songs of buoyant misery, sung by citizens of the New Quarter. Eventually the bouquet of *m\xc3\xad* fruit fills the air, and one is surely in N\xc3\xa1s-Es.'

b"In the Goldsmiths' District of the city, the back-streets are lined with *tum* flowers, and the emerald leaves sway in the early night wind. Criminals flock here, practising their skill on the *p\xc3\xa9* field. In the afternoon, a traveller may typically hear the tolling of the dancing-hall clock."
