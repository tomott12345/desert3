# b'nu-Sunsu to Tonnuk'

## b'So-kuk-Tonul'
b'A traveller, passing into the city of So-kuk-Tonul, may discern the marble spires of the iniquitous prison of Pumo-Nek. Though from so far it may appear enchanting, people of the city find its form distasteful, and hide from it. Closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the tolling of the temple clock. Ultimately the smell of *lop* bushes fills the breeze, and one has undeniably arrived.'

b"Close to the theatre of Nek-kuk-Top, the squares are lined with *lotu* plants. The *lopsu* trees will be clear. These serve as a vestige of the pestilence which recently ravaged the Fishmongers' Quarter. If a traveller is so unfortunate as to catch sight of merchants dancing, it can be three hours before escape is possible."

## b'Lep-Ke'
b'Leaving So-kuk-Tonul the traveller can go west to Lep-Ke. The road is arduous, but rewarding, taking many weeks. Along the way the track crosses a deep canyon, spotted with *kul* flowers. When one enters Tu-Ton, the foliage changes, giving way to scrubland and hedgerows. *Nok* graze near the route.'

b'On reaching the walls of gargantuan Lep-Ke a traveller will stumble upon a series of pedlars, hawking their wares. Somewhat nearer to the centre of the city, the traveller begins to hear the clanging of the bastion clock. At last the bouquet of *lop* bushes fills the air, and a traveller is truly in Lep-Ke.'

b"In the Tailors' District of the city, the roadways are paved with stone, inlaid with marble. The traveller will see the obsidian statues that adorn the eaves. These ward off hostile influences. Farmers throng here, singing. Should one be blessed enough to see a game of *lok*, one may be drawn in, and it may be an afternoon before escape is possible."

## b'Tonul-Kes'
b'Leaving Lep-Ke a traveller may travel to Tonul-Kes. Near the fringe of the route, mighty *nok* graze. At one point the track crosses a broad valley, spotted with *lotu* plants. As the traveller crosses into Top-kuk-Ton, there is a variation in the quality of the light, and a harsh cast falls upon the land.'

b'The traveller, outside the great city of Tonul-Kes, will espy the silver lookout of the colossal counting-house of Seso-kuk-Te. At such a large distance, the traveller is unable to see how artisans crowd near it, laughing and talking. Nearer to the heart of the city, one will begin to hear songs of merry dejection, sung by writers of a nearby village. Eventually the fragrance of *popku* fruit fills the breeze, and one has beyond doubt arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the university of Sesum-kuk-Tu, the back-streets are lined with *lopsu* flowers. The tame *sen* birds will be apparent. These signify the place of business of an apothecary. Labourers cluster here, trying their luck at the game of *lokpuk*.'

## b'nu-Muko-Ke'
b'From Tonul-Kes a traveller can journey north-east to nu-Muko-Ke. Off the stern vermillion *pek* fish may usually be seen. One may enjoy boiled seaweed, as eaten by the crew. Although the crossing is easy, storms typically trouble craft.'

b'Near the outskirts of famous nu-Muko-Ke the traveller may catch sight of the mighty citadel of Nek-Sokkus. Even though from so far it seems elegant, denizens of the city find its architecture repellent, and steer clear of it. Closer to the centre of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the delicate song of the *telsum* birds, kept by philosophers. Finally the scent of *popku* fruit fills the wind, and one is surely in nu-Muko-Ke.'

b'In the Green Quarter, the streets are paved with lead, inlaid with basalt. Should the traveller be so unlucky as to catch sight of a fight between two lovers, it may be half a day before escape is possible. Soldiers lounge here, praying.'
