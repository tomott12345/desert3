# b'Sgu\xc5\xbeszi\xc5\xbe to Szu\xc5\xbeskun'

## b'\xc5\xbdupsrab'
b'The traveller, approaching the outskirts of the metropolis of \xc5\xbdupsrab, can see hairy *s\xc4\x8dupsrab*, the sacred animal of Sgu\xc5\xbeszi\xc5\xbe. Nearer to the centre of the city, a traveller will hear songs of joyous dejection, sung by artisans of a nearby village. Finally the smell of *marsbut* fruit fills the wind, and one has surely arrived.'

b'Near the citadel, the back-streets are paved with lead, inlaid with *\xc4\x8di\xc5\xa1gam* stone. Citizens crowd here, practising their skill on the *sdassga\xc5\xa1* board. In the morning, the traveller may typically hear songs of mournful bliss, sung by writers of the city.'

## b'\xc5\xbduppa\xc5\xbe'
b'Leaving \xc5\xbdupsrab the traveller can travel north to \xc5\xbduppa\xc5\xbe. *Gulnig* flowers grow on the road. When a traveller enters Szu\xc5\xbeskun, the foliage changes, giving way to meadows and pastures. Along the way the track crosses a broad rift, spotted with *smagsnat* bushes.'

b'Passing into celebrated \xc5\xbduppa\xc5\xbe one will catch sight of the idle rich, laughing. A little closer to the heart of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the tolling of the fortress clock. In the end the bouquet of *smaggu\xc5\xbe* trees fills the air, and a traveller has undeniably arrived.'

b'Around the castle of Sku\xc5\xbesgu\xc4\x8d, the roadways are lined with *tukspa\xc5\xbe* plants, and the yellow blossoms whisper in the evening breeze. If one is so fortunate as to encounter merchants singing, it may be half a day before escape is possible. An inattentive traveller will not notice the *guls\xc5\xbeuz* flowers. These indicate the workplace of a doctor. Philosophers throng here, praying.'
