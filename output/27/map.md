# b'Tschuzona to Nagotsi'

## b'Tutukiri'
b'A traveller, on reaching the gates of the city of Tutukiri, will discern the copper clock-tower of the immense watchtower of Beborotscha. Although from so far it may seem enchanting, the denizens of the city find its form distasteful, and stay away from it. Nearer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller begins to hear the sweet song of the *tschiputibo* birds, kept by artisans. Eventually the perfume of *tigomigo* fruit fills the air, and a traveller is surely in Tutukiri.'

b'In the Green Quarter of the city, the plazas are paved with sandstone. Soldiers teem here, trying their luck at *schodanu*. One can often hear the chimes of the palace clock. Should one be charmed enough to stumble upon the sacred Ketsararu ceremony, it may be a most edifying experience. The caged *schoschopu* birds will be easy to see. These function as a reminder of the sickness which twenty years ago ravaged the surrounding countryside.'

## b'Rakiri'
b'From Tutukiri the traveller can journey west to Rakiri. Vividly striped *daschetschi* fish may occasionally be observed near the side of the boat, leaping from wave to wave. The crossing is surprisingly safe, even with the stormy weather conditions which typically torment ships near here. One will enjoy salted turtle meat, as eaten by both fishermen and passengers. The meaty taste is tasty, enriched by the salty air. The shore, a traveller can see flocks of seabirds, circling overhead.'

b'Near to great Rakiri a traveller can observe the chryselephantine spire of the infamous prison of Kobamu. From here, one cannot see how petty criminals hide from it. Somewhat closer to the centre of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the song of the *tschiputibo* birds, kept by priests. At last the musk of *zupotscho* bushes fills the wind, and a traveller has truly arrived.'

b"In the vicinity of the fortress of Zatschabomu, the boulevards are lined with *malapo* plants, and the delicate smell fills the late afternoon breeze. In the early night, one may often hear songs of exuberant gloom, sung by writers of the Tailors' District. In the event that a traveller is so unfortunate as to catch sight of a herd of *pischabo*, the national animal of Nagotsi, one might be drawn in, and find it tricky to escape. The traveller will be impressed by the ivory figures which adorn the rooftops. These serve as a caution to unwanted spirits."
