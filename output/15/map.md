# b'Sischi to Sup\xc3\xa9tu'

## b'Tsuza'
b'The traveller, near the walls of the infamous city of Tsuza, will see the copper clock-tower of the monumental palace of P\xc3\xa9muk\xc3\xadze. A little closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller begins to hear the delicate song of the *gim\xc3\xa1* birds. Finally the smell of *potsche* bushes fills the breeze, and the traveller has beyond doubt arrived.'

b'Near the barbican of Zeschescho, the boulevards are paved with limestone, inlaid with bronze. A traveller can usually hear the sound of the theatre clock. The caged *s\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa1gi* birds will be conspicuous. These betoken the shop of a smith. Actors congregate here, talking and laughing. If the traveller is fortunate enough to find merchants talking, it may be a most edifying experience.'

## b'Zakusepu'
b'Onwards from Tsuza one may go north to Zakusepu. The road is arduous, but rewarding, taking some weeks. Near the edge of the track, *disi* trees grow. When one crosses the border into L\xc3\xa1lolu, there is a variation in the quality of the light, and a pale cast falls over the countryside. Along the way the route crosses a deep gorge, spotted with *tsched\xc3\xad* plants.'

b'A traveller, nearing the gates of famed Zakusepu, can espy the ivory towers of the gargantuan prison of G\xc3\xadzek\xc3\xadze. Despite the fact that from so far it appear enchanting, the people of Zakusepu find its form unsavoury, and hide from it. Slightly nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller will begin to hear songs of mirthful gloom, sung by labourers of a nearby village. At last the fragrance of *potsche* flowers fills the air, and a traveller is without a doubt in Zakusepu.'

b'In the Temple District of the city, the plazas are lined with *disi* bushes. In the event that one is so lucky as to catch sight of a herd of *tam\xc3\xa1*, bred for show by the soldiers of the city, it may be a couple of hours before escape is possible. In the afternoon, the traveller may sometimes hear the knell of the university clock. Artisans crowd here, practising their skill on the *schetsere* tables. A distracted traveller will overlook the ivory carvings that ornament the eaves. These serve as a relic of the sickness which twenty years ago devastated the surrounding countryside.'

## b'Polipusa'
b'Onwards from Zakusepu a traveller can travel north-west to Polipusa. It is a simple journey. When the traveller enters Ruzap\xc3\xads\xc3\xad, there is a shift in the light, and a grey cast falls across the landscape. Horned *tats\xc3\xad* graze on the fringe of the track. At one point the route crosses a broad rift, spotted with *tsched\xc3\xad* flowers.'

b'Near to iniquitous Polipusa one may see hawkers, setting out their stalls. Somewhat closer to the heart of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the song of the *s\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa1gi* birds, kept by the idle rich. Finally the perfume of *tschusche* fruit fills the wind, and the traveller has beyond doubt arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the market-hall of Tsch\xc3\xadschop\xc3\xad, the squares are paved with lead. The bourgeoisie gather here, telling stories. If a traveller is so unfortunate as to encounter an altercation between two lovers, it can be half a day before escape is possible. In the early evening, the traveller can usually hear the clanging of the theatre clock. The *potsche* trees will be easy to see to one. These function as a warning to hostile spirits.'

## b'Tsch\xc3\xa1ne'
b'From Polipusa a traveller may journey to Tsch\xc3\xa1ne. As one enters Sup\xc3\xa9tu, the vegetation changes, giving way to pastures and hedgerows. Along the way the road crosses a deep ravine, spotted with *tsched\xc3\xad* flowers.'

b'Entering the tremendous metropolis of Tsch\xc3\xa1ne a traveller can come across merchants, showing off at the game of *schetsere*. Nearer to the centre of the city, the traveller can faintly hear songs of melancholy delight, sung by labourers of a nearby village. At last the scent of *disi* plants fills the air, and one is undoubtedly in Tsch\xc3\xa1ne.'

b"In the Fishmongers' District of the city, the boulevards are lined with *ts\xc3\xadtsch\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xad* bushes, and the sweet smell fills the late night breeze. Should a traveller be unlucky enough to see the intricate R\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xad parade, it can be a very educational experience. Priests teem here, singing. The traveller will see the tame *pob\xc3\xa1* birds. These repel evil influences. In the late morning, a traveller may often hear the song of the *s\xc3\xa1m\xc3\xa1gi* birds, kept by citizens."
