# b'Ololon to up Ekon\xc3\xbck'

## b'Apop\xc3\xbcp'
b'A traveller, entering the great city, can make out the basalt tower of the monstrous counting-house of Osek\xc3\xbcs. From so far, one is unable to observe how scholars shun it, telling stories and laughing. A little closer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller will begin to hear the striking of the bastion clock. At last the smell of *animal* bushes fills the wind, and a traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b"In the Tailors' District of the city, the roadways are lined with *ukulan* flowers, and the fragrant leaves whisper in the breeze. Labourers flock here, singing. A careless traveller will not notice the caged *analep* birds. These serve as a deterrent to evil influences. The traveller can typically hear songs of elegiac exuberance, sung by petty criminals of Apop\xc3\xbcp. Should one be blessed enough to stumble upon the holy Imas\xc3\xbck ritual, it may be a most humbling experience."

## b'\xc3\x9cpepan'
b'Onwards from Apop\xc3\xbcp a traveller can travel south-west to \xc3\x9cpepan. The road is well-trodden, and the journey takes but an afternoon. At one point the track crosses a deep gorge, spotted with *\xc3\xbckanuk* bushes. Mighty *olopan* graze near the edge of the route. When the traveller enters Alunas, there is a change in the light, and a grey cast falls over the countryside.'

b'The traveller, nearing the walls of the iniquitous city of \xc3\x9cpepan, may see citizens, practising their skill at the game of *epumun*. Nearer to the centre of the city, a traveller can faintly hear songs of merry misery, sung by farmers of the surrounding countryside. In the end the musk of *opanim* fruit fills the wind, and the traveller is undoubtedly in \xc3\x9cpepan.'

b'In the Grey Quarter, the boulevards are paved with ivory, inlaid with obsidian. In the event that one is so lucky as to come across actors praying, it can be half a day before escape is possible. Priests swarm here, laughing.'

## b'\xc3\x9ctelop'
b'Leaving \xc3\x9cpepan a traveller may travel south-west to \xc3\x9ctelop. By the roadside, *ukulan* plants grow. As the traveller crosses the border into Ikulas, the foliage changes, giving way to hedgerows and groves of *\xc3\xbclinan* trees.'

b'Near the edge of gargantuan \xc3\x9ctelop one may discern the great dancing-hall of Up Utakak. Even though at such a large distance it appear alluring, the citizens of \xc3\x9ctelop find its architecture disagreeable, and stay away from it. Somewhat nearer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller will begin to hear the knell of the palace clock. Ultimately the perfume of *ekosan* flowers fills the air, and the traveller has truly arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the citadel of Utomel, the plazas are paved with basalt, inlaid with sandstone. Should a traveller be fortunate enough to catch sight of an altercation between two lovers, one might be drawn in, and it may be two hours before escape is possible. In the late night, a traveller may sometimes hear the pleasant song of the *ukalal* birds, kept by the bourgeoisie. The *\xc3\xbckanuk* bushes will be obvious to one. These indicate the workplace of an apothecary.'

## b'Omapok'
b'From \xc3\x9ctelop the traveller can journey north-west to Omapok. The road is arduous, but rewarding, taking two weeks. Along the way the track crosses a broad depression. When one enters up Ekon\xc3\xbck, there is a variation in the quality of the light, and a bluish cast falls upon the landscape. *\xc3\x9cnanal* plants grow near the roadside.'

b'A traveller, passing into the metropolis of Omapok, can stumble upon horned *ukepal*, valued for their meat. A little closer to the centre of the city, the traveller begins to hear songs of sombre delight, sung by actors of the city. Finally the musk of *opanim* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller is undeniably in Omapok.'

b'Near the temple, the back-streets are lined with *ekosan* bushes, and the sweet aroma fills the late evening air. The idle rich crowd here, trying their luck on the *op\xc3\xbcl\xc3\xbcl* tables. One will notice the stone statues that grace the archways. These denote the place of business of a fortune-teller. In the event that the traveller is so charmed as to find a game of *op\xc3\xbclap*, it can be a very instructive experience. In the early afternoon, the traveller can occasionally hear the chimes of the theatre clock.'
