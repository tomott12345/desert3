## b'\xc3\x8dlil-\xc3\xadz-Iz\xc3\xa9b'
b'The traveller, entering the great metropolis, can catch sight of hairy *adiz*, beloved for their leather. A little closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller will hear the knell of the mint clock. At last the musk of *\xc3\xadbim* flowers fills the wind, and one is surely in \xc3\x8dlil-\xc3\xadz-Iz\xc3\xa9b.'

b'In the New Quarter, the squares are paved with *\xc3\xa1z\xc3\xa9sch* stone. The sandstone figurines that decorate the eaves will be conspicuous to the traveller. These serve as a warning to unwanted influences. In the early morning, a traveller can sometimes hear songs of blissful sadness, sung by actors of the Grey Quarter.'

## b'\xc3\x89b\xc3\xadtsch'
b'Onwards from \xc3\x8dlil-\xc3\xadz-Iz\xc3\xa9b the traveller may journey to \xc3\x89b\xc3\xadtsch. It is a simple journey. Along the way the route crosses a deep canyon, spotted with *itsch\xc3\xadb* bushes. Near the side of the track, *id\xc3\xa9m* plants grow. As one enters \xc3\x81schitsch, there is a change in the quality of the light, and a harsh cast falls over the terrain.'

b'Nearing the outskirts of the monstrous city of \xc3\x89b\xc3\xadtsch a traveller may discern the ruby vaulted roof of the infamous counting-house of Okib-\xc3\x89tschot. Somewhat nearer to the heart of the city, one will hear the delicate song of the *it\xc3\xadp* birds. Ultimately the perfume of *es\xc3\xadb* trees fills the air, and the traveller has undeniably arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the watchtower of Eschib, the back-streets are lined with *\xc3\xa9m\xc3\xa1b* bushes, and the sweet smell fills the late night wind. Philosophers swarm here, talking. Should a traveller be so unfortunate as to stumble upon a game of *in\xc3\xadm*, one may be drawn in, and find it almost impossible to escape.'

## b'\xc3\x8dtschib'
b'Leaving \xc3\x89b\xc3\xadtsch a traveller can travel to \xc3\x8dtschib. When the traveller crosses the border into \xc3\x81sch\xc3\xa9z-\xc3\x81kis, the foliage changes, giving way to *\xc3\xadbim* flowers and hedgerows. Shaggy *\xc3\xa9tsetsch* graze on the roadside. At one point the road crosses a broad valley, spotted with *id\xc3\xa9m* plants.'

b'A traveller, at the edge of the famed city, may come across citizens, showing off at the game of *in\xc3\xadm*. Slightly closer to the centre of the city, one will begin to hear songs of forlorn joy, sung by merchants of the city. In the end the aroma of *otsch\xc3\xadn* fruit fills the air, and a traveller has without a doubt arrived.'

b'In the Old District of the city, the roadways are paved with marble, inlaid with stone. The traveller will see the *\xc3\xa1sil* trees. These are a vestige of the plague which recently engulfed the surrounding countryside. In the event that one is charmed enough to catch sight of a game of *okin*, it may be a most educational experience. A traveller can occasionally hear the gentle song of the *uzit* birds, kept by priests. The bourgeoisie cluster here, praying and dancing.'
