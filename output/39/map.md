## b'Stun-t\xc3\xa4k-Tos'
b'Nearing the gates of the city of Stun-t\xc3\xa4k-Tos one will stumble upon horned *snem*, beloved for their leather. Slightly closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller can faintly hear the sound of the castle clock. Ultimately the bouquet of *slop* fruit fills the air, and one is undeniably in Stun-t\xc3\xa4k-Tos.'

b'In the Red District of the city, the streets are paved with ivory, inlaid with stone. The tame *stot* birds will be obvious to the traveller. These commemorate the plague which in times past devastated the city. In the event that a traveller is so lucky as to come across a herd of shaggy *nop*, bred for racing by the merchants of a nearby village, one might be drawn in, and unable to leave. Philosophers crowd here, dancing.'

## b'Tossnat'
b'Leaving Stun-t\xc3\xa4k-Tos a traveller can travel north-west to Tossnat. When the traveller crosses the border into Stun-K\xc3\xa4smom, there is a shift in the quality of the light, and a golden cast falls upon the terrain. Mighty *snem* graze near the route. At one point the road crosses a deep gully.'

b'The traveller, outside the monumental city, will catch sight of the silver clock-tower of the monstrous temple of Pam-Kemsnep. Although at this distance it may seem magnificent, the natives of Tossnat find its bulk disagreeable, and hide from it. A little nearer to the centre of the city, one begins to hear songs of buoyant misery, sung by farmers of the Temple Quarter. In the end the aroma of *t\xc3\xbcn* plants fills the breeze, and one has undoubtedly arrived.'

b'In the vicinity of the citadel of Lon-Set, the plazas are lined with *t\xc3\xbcn* flowers. Soldiers gather here, talking and telling stories. A traveller will notice the *t\xc3\xbcn* trees. These mark the place of business of an artisan. If the traveller is fortunate enough to encounter an argument between two lovers, it can be half a day before escape is possible.'

## b'Skommon'
b'Onwards from Tossnat a traveller may go to Skommon. The track is busy, and the journey takes but an afternoon. Along the way the road crosses a broad rift. By the roadside, hairy *nopspak* graze.'

b'Near to Skommon one can see the granite tower of the infamous palace of Set-K\xc3\xa4tsnum. From so far, one cannot observe how priests shun it, practising their skill on the *miksnit* field. Closer to the heart of the city, the traveller will hear the song of the *stotsk\xc3\xa4l* birds. Finally the scent of *slopsin* fruit fills the wind, and a traveller is without a doubt in Skommon.'

b"In the Actors' District of the city, the squares are paved with granite, inlaid with bronze. In the event that one is so charmed as to see a herd of horned *snem*, beloved for their meat, the traveller may be drawn in, and it may be half a day before escape is possible. In the early afternoon, one may often hear songs of dirgeful pleasure, sung by the bourgeoisie of the surrounding countryside. The caged *tostip* birds will be apparent. These denote the workplace of a smith."
