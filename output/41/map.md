# b'Nerketot to Ulkers'

## b'Kospuls'
b'A traveller, passing into the great metropolis of Kospuls, can stumble upon *opuksors*, the national animal of Nerketot. Somewhat closer to the centre of the city, one begins to hear the tolling of the citadel clock. Finally the fragrance of *lusnerk* flowers fills the air, and one is beyond doubt in Kospuls.'

b'Close to the fortress, the roadways are paved with obsidian. Should a traveller be so unlucky as to catch sight of a herd of shaggy *omors*, bred for work by the actors of the city, it may be two hours before escape is possible. In the early morning, the traveller may occasionally hear the balmy song of the *olnuslum* birds, kept by writers. Soldiers throng here, practising their skill at the game of *sosselkun*.'

## b'Pulsomtolt'
b'Leaving Kospuls one may journey north to Pulsomtolt. *Solpop* bushes grow by the road. As a traveller enters Otsukon, the vegetation changes, giving way to open fields and pastures. At one point the track crosses a broad rift, spotted with *lusnerk* plants.'

b'Near to the city one can espy the glistening vaulted roof of the infamous dancing-hall of Selkton. Despite the fact that from so far it may look alluring, citizens of Pulsomtolt find its form repellent, and avoid it. A little nearer to the heart of the city, the traveller can faintly hear songs of melancholy glee, sung by merchants of the surrounding countryside. At last the perfume of *solpop* bushes fills the wind, and a traveller has surely arrived.'

b"In the Tailors' Quarter of the city, the back-streets are lined with *lussors* flowers, and the emerald blossoms shimmer in the evening air. One will see the bronze medallions which adorn the balustrades. These act as a caution to hostile influences. If a traveller is unfortunate enough to encounter a game of *elnsos*, it can be a most instructive experience."

## b'Nussult'
b'From Pulsomtolt the traveller may travel south-west to Nussult. One can see flocks of seabirds the shore, diving for *ulolnnerk* fish. The crossing is surprisingly pleasant, even with the gales which often trouble boats in this area.'

b'Near the edge of the city of Nussult the traveller may stumble upon silversmiths, hawking their wares. A little closer to the inner parts of the city, a traveller begins to hear the bells of the theatre clock. Finally the smell of *erssolsors* fruit fills the wind, and one is truly in Nussult.'

b'Around the castle, the plazas are lined with *lussors* bushes, and the pleasant scent fills the morning breeze. Farmers teem here, telling stories. In the late night, a traveller can usually hear the song of the *olnuslum* birds. Should one be so lucky as to come across actors laughing, the traveller may be drawn in, and find it difficult to escape.'
