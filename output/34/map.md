## b'Mrapkon'
b'On entering the iniquitous city of Mrapkon one will catch sight of *puhmlimtok*, prized for their horns. A little nearer to the centre of the city, a traveller begins to hear the sweet song of the *traptam* birds, kept by farmers. Ultimately the bouquet of *mepkehhektop* bushes fills the wind, and one has without a doubt arrived.'

b"In the Goldsmiths' Quarter of the city, the streets are paved with stone, inlaid with lead. In the night, a traveller can typically hear the peal of the castle clock. Soldiers congregate here, practising their skill on the *nrokhakkahhlem* court. Should the traveller be so fortunate as to encounter the sacred Tihpahprem ceremony, a traveller might be drawn in, and unable to leave. One will be humbled by the *menhup* stone carvings that ornament the lintels. These denote the workplace of a smith."

## b'Konnluh'
b'Onwards from Mrapkon the traveller can go south to Konnluh. Many craft sail these waters, so a traveller can often charter a fishing boat. There are usually silver *mrukkupplet* fish in the water nearby, moving in unison. One can hear seabirds the shore, riding the air.'

b'A traveller, approaching the walls of the mighty city, will see the immense barbican of Prukpam. From so far, a traveller cannot discern how artisans hide from it. Slightly nearer to the inner parts of the city, the traveller can faintly hear the song of the *krutponhliktrap* birds. In the end the musk of *hrekplokhlum* fruit fills the breeze, and a traveller is truly in Konnluh.'

b'Close to the citadel of Hlathlok, the squares are lined with *mramkehmram* flowers. One may sometimes hear songs of desolate delight, sung by priests of the city. If a traveller is blessed enough to see a game of *nrokhakkahhlem*, it can be a very edifying experience. Philosophers mill here, singing. The *mepkehhektop* trees will be clear to the traveller. These are a deterrent to unwanted spirits.'

## b'Nluhmep'
b'From Konnluh one can journey north-west to Nluhmep. One will enjoy a stew made of turtle meat and *hupkupmramkeh* fruit, spiced with *mramkehmram* leaves, as eaten by crew and passengers alike. The dark flavour is delicious, mingling with the salty air. Ships are tormented by bad weather conditions in this area, but the crossing is easy. The coast flocks of *kikprep* birds can typically be observed.'

b'Near to Nluhmep the traveller may come across crowds of pedlars, setting out their stalls. Somewhat closer to the centre of the city, a traveller will hear the song of the *traptam* birds, kept by farmers. Finally the perfume of *huhhlikhupprep* fruit fills the wind, and the traveller has surely arrived.'

b'In the Ancient District, the back-streets are paved with obsidian. Citizens throng here, dancing and telling stories. In the event that a traveller is so unlucky as to catch sight of an argument between two lovers, it can be half a day before escape is possible. In the evening, one can sometimes hear the knell of the palace clock. A distracted traveller will miss the tame *nuktrapnruttran* birds. These betoken the place of business of a doctor.'
