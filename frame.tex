In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of
a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire,
the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer
satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size
was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The
following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as
their Forebears had been, saw that that vast map was Useless, and not without
some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun
and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins
of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no
other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.
